Too many lies in this para=
In following para, yogindar sikand is a muslim convert and his name is mentioned as Hindu representative. The first statement is a lie as he is not a hindu representative.

Representatives of Hinduism held a variety of views on Muhammad, some with an assertion that the prophet was none else than the Narashansrishi of the Vedas, predicted in the Atharva Veda.[183] One of the prominent Vaishnava proponents, A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada maintained that Mohammad and Jesus, were empowered representatives of God, saktiavesa avataras.[184] In a variety of other points of view, some translated the phrase """"the last prophet"""", suggesting that Vedic deity Agni is none other but Muhammad.[185] In 1926 Siddiq Hussain's two-volume Kannada book, Ja at Guru Sarwar-i 'Alam, argued that the Muhammad was actually Kalki avatar whose arrival had been predicted in the Hindu scriptures, however this view is not a widely accepted doctrine.[186] On the other hand Mirza Ghulani Ahmad argued that Rama and Krishna were prophets of God who had foretold the arrival of Muhammad as God's last law-bearing prophet.[187] Mohammad is sometimes linked to the passage of the Rig Veda declaring that Narashams rishi will arrive as the """"last divine messenger"""" (antim deva duta), who shall """"dispel all darkness"""" and """"conquer death"""".[188]""",[],0

 Luis Miguel Gallego Basteri 

I would consider your move from Luis Miguel to Luis Miguel Gallego Basteri as a highly controversial renaming of an article. Please do not take offense, but I am positive that you are not familiar with this topic, or Spanish culture in general. Here are my thoughts on this:

 Luis Miguel is a singer of worldwide fame and much more notable than the other four Luis Miguels that you included in that disambiguation list.
 Luis Miguel is much more of a public figure than any other Luis Miguel, since he is a Grammy winner and is often romantically associated with big stars, such as Mariah Carey, Daisy Fuentes, etc.
 Please also note that """"Luis Miguel"""" is his professional name, and that is why he is notable, he is not a scientist or politician or any other profession where a full name is used. 
 Also only one of the other Luis Miguels has an article, therefore people looking for """"Luis Miguel"""" will be taken to that disambig page while almost all of them will be looking for the singer and not anybody else. 
 In addition, none of the other Luis Miguels go by """"Luis Miguel"""" only the singer.

Championship does not mean """"first place."""" For example, in 2001 the St. Louis Cardinals and Houston Astros tied for 1st place in the NL Central Division. MLB did not recognize co-champions, allowing only Houston to raise a banner indicating that they won the Division Championship and print the same in their media guide. By contrast, in college athletics in the United States it is routine to recognize as co-champions any teams that finish tied for 1st without applying tiebreakers. This is because the recognition of a champion is in the hands of the organizing body. Here is a great example of the phenomenon I'm talking about: http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory?id=3033084.

"Courtney Here are my suggestions from my Peer Review of your article Chunking, (Psychology)  by: Dan Hurlburt
Considering the fact that this article was removed by a previous editor I just looked in the articles history and examined the latest edited form of the article before the changes were undone in order to complete my peer review.

The lead section provides a good stand alone summary of Chunking, in psychology.  The article already has a strong intro that didn’t require much editing in the form of adding new material. It did however, require some fine tuned modifications that I think she did a good job of locating and crossing out words and rephrasing sentences that needed to be more specific.  The contribution does not seem to be cut and pasted from an existing source it flows well with the article and is properly placed.   The terms used go along with the articles style well and are easy to understand.  One sentence that sounds a little confusing when read is “Runners may chunk the numbers into different relevant mile, or other distances, times.” May need a little more elaboration just to clear up the point you are trying to get across.  In the Short term memory section the sentence:  “The short term memory processes (stores) information for about twenty to thirty seconds”  I think needs a word or two added in, in order to complete the thought, I tried to include a suggestion.     May need a little more elaboration just to clear up the point you are trying to get across.  She relates to her references where it seems necessary.  Even though the article already includes a decent amount of information she finds the areas that did need further elaboration and creates an appropriate section for the information.  Grammar and verb tenses and spelling all match up well with the rest of the article.  One area where a wiki link may help the article is in the section where she is talking about short term memory, possible link to Short Term Memory but I don’t think that it is necessary, since she does explain it a little using a reference.  Her references match up well with the rest of the ones listed in the document in format and when investigating them, they all are relevant to the subject matter and provide useful information for the article.

Your talent at invoking """"personal attack"""" seems to exceed your talent at replying intelligently to any of my points.

If you can't take the heat, you shouldn't be editing an encyclopedia.  It's pretty clear that Wikipedia's """"personal attack"""" policy is simply a ploy to ban people with whom the administrators disagree, and prevent them from making contributions to Wikipedia, while at the same time preserving the illusion of some level playing field for intellectual discourse.  

To illustrate this point, we need look no further than the items removed by Jimbo from the Justin Berry talk page, citing """"personal attack"""", which included every mention of the term """"camwhore,"""" which is itself a Wikipedia topic, and the following paragraph.  Please feel free to try and figure out who is the victim of the """"personal attack"""" here.

""""I'm dissapointed that the majority of this page was deleted, most likely because one of the editors is a self-admitted pedophile. Is it fair to declare that a pedophile can't be neutral on a page that involves pedophilia?. I guarantee that wikipedia wouldn't ban a Jew from editing a page on the holocaust, or ban a black person from editing a page on affirmative action. A pedophile is just as capable of editing with a neutral POV on a subject matter dealing with pedophilia, as a Jew or a black would be on an issue that involves Jews or blacks. Wikipedia claims to be a online encyclopedia that anyone can edit. If that doesn't include pedophiles, than how is that fair?. If we allow certain sexual minorities to be silenced, what's next?, allowing certain racial minorities to be silenced as well. As a frequent reader and occasional editor of wikipedia, I only want to read factual, neutral POV articles, and I don't care about the race, nationality, ethnicity, sex, or sexual orientation of the editor. Even if most people have moral objections to pedophilia, surely we can agree that we all have a right to post on wikipedia as long as we abide by the rules.""""  TAB

Also it would have to be paired with fact that the specimen (almost exclusively associated with Y-DNA R1a1) from South Siberia and Kazakhstan (*) had almost exclusively mtDNA haplogroups of west eurasian/european origin especially during bronze age (as far as 1,800 BC). If we link that with the europoid phenotypes with light-colored eyes and hair and pale skin of andronovo south siberians described in the recent article of human genetics 
( http://www.springerlink.com/content/4462755368m322k8/ ), that's meaningful and favors an European origin of these R1a1. 
Especially since no south Asian haplogroups are linked to the spread of R1a1, up to Europe. 
.
Pretty meaningful, especially since such phenotypes are found where high frequency of R1a1 are found in Asia (like 
Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, east Afghanistan and north Pakistan) -> examples of such clearly europoid phenotypes in these regions of Asia that matches the description of south Siberian of Bronze age (andronovo culture horizon),

Hi. Yes, I suppose that you are right to revert my edit on John Duncan (theologian). When I read the article initially I believe that I primarily 'saw' that he was already going to university to pursue theological study without taking a more granular look at what the text actually says and integrating in my comprehension what that meant. He is an unusual fellow in that he was apparently an atheist (according to his own conception) who was already studying to become a doctrinal minister which runs counterintuitive to my expectation of those who study theology. Theological students may have some misgivings about their beliefs and doctrine but are not ordinarily 'atheist', or even deist, in their self-description. Thanks for the reversion.

"Deletion of Malenovski and Kiev school district citations 

Given that this is a contested article, I wanted to explain my reasoning in recent changes.  Firstly,  I inserted exact statistical per centages for the # of schools teaching in Ukrainian.  I did this b/c using partly to characterize 48% and overwhelmingly to characterize 70% is really pushing it.  48% is almost 1/2 and 70 is about 3/4.  Partly sounds like 1/5-2/5 and overwhelmingly is somewhere between 85%-99% broadly understood.

Now about the Kiev's school district footnote.  In my opinion, whereas the information is true, it is too narrow for our purposes here.  Citing national or at least regional statistics seems more appropriate.  As for Malenovski's article, the issue was unverifiability of the statistics.  I read through the article and came to the section where Malenovski cites the numbers (towards the end).  They are there, but no original source is named, no link is given for verification of the numbers.  Finally, I hope that wikipedia editors contributing to Ukrainization will continue to insist on the level of scholarship expected and enforced for sources/articles dealing with the Holodomor article.  Citing Malenovski and going to the lengths of translating his pov (in this case) is rather unacceptable.

By the way, I certainly prefer Gogol in Russian than in translation to English, Polish or Ukrainian.  How can you not love?:

I am curious what all the other wiki editors who have been following this think.  Of course it will be difficult for them to research the sources you have removed and now locked out.  How about that.  

Suggestion: if you were really as honest as you like to think you are, you would put both articles on the page for everyone to read and vote on.  Yours as it now is, and mine as I last left it.

It says in the instruction to new editors to assume good faith.  That has not been my experience of you, and from my point of view, you have now demonstrated that beyond any doubt.
There are other issues here.  Everywhere I look in wikipedia I see poorly written, out of date articles, or articles with messages requesting that someone update them.  I am curious how many others have had similar experiences to what I have had here and who have lost interest and moved on? Does anyone keep track of wikipedia's hit count and how it has changed over the years?  Or the number of active wiki editors?  I wouldn't be surprised one little bit to find out it both have leveled out and gone into decline.  If so, has it occurred to you that that might be a signal of some sort?
This issue also points out another major flaw in wikipedia; the fact that a single admitted non-expert in a field of study can override multiple experts from NASA, Lockheed Martin, JPL, etc., on a topic as you have done here. 

You have some serious issues here.  I will be interested in seeing how you resolve them, assuming that you can.  Or will this article remain as it now is, another stone in the constipated belly of wikipedia, for years to come?

I just had an idea.  I am going to put the article as I last left it right here so that the other wiki editors who have been following this can read and compare without editorials from either of us.  
It will be interesting to see if you have the courage to leave it alone and allow others to form their own opinion and do their own research.

A skyhook is a proposed space transportation concept that aims to reduce the cost of placing payloads into space. 

Skyhooks are often confused with an Earth surface to geostationary orbit space elevator, but they are different.  A skyhook is much shorter than a space elevator and does not reach down to the surface of the Earth.  A skyhook requires a suborbital launch vehicle to get to the bottom end of the skyhook, a space elevator does not.  Due to the much shorter length of the skyhook and the resulting reduction in strain, skyhooks up to 4,000 km in length can be built with existing materials, while an Earth surface to geostationary orbit space elevator cannot.Amanda S. Wu, Tsu-Wei Chou, """"Carbon Nanotube Fibers for Advanced Composites"""", Materials Today, vol. 15, July–August 2012, pp. 302-310   

The advantage of a skyhook it that the lower end of the cable is moving at less than orbital velocity for its altitude.  As a result, a launch vehicle flying to the bottom of the skyhook can carry a larger payload than it could going directly to orbit on its own.  When the cable is long enough, single stage to skyhook flight with a reusable launch vehicle such as a spaceplane becomes possible.  Reusability of the launch vehicle and an enlarged payload fraction makes for much lower launch costs.   Once the cable has become long enough the skyhook becomes cost competitive with what is realistically thought to be achievable using a space elevator (assuming a space elevator can ever be built), and the skyhook can be built.{{cite jour",[],0

 p values and the 0.05 standard 

Hi, I'm curious about the origins of the 0.05 p -value standard and didn't want to continue the discussion on the homeopathy talk page, so I hope you don't mind a question here.  I admittedly oversimplified my statement about 0.05 being arbitrary, mainly in an effort to save space and not overexert myself in addressing another editor.  Clearly, """"arbitrary"""" was not the best word, but what I'm curious about is the origins of two standard deviations being established as the cut off for significance.  Is there any inherent reason why two SDs are significant, or is it simply a convenient attribute of any distribution which can be used to define outlying data points?

 First a suggestion for Sarah Welsh, if you are """"struggling"""", and that too with the very first words of the article , just hold off rather than going ahead and still editing the article (and making it, as you did in this case, almost impossible for anyone to comprehend). This is not someone's personal blog, but a page with more than 2000 daily views. So please act with discretion.

 Second, your allegation that my edits """"distorted and misrepresented the sources such as Nesbitt's OUP book"""" is a complete LIE. I did not even bring in the Nesbitt book.

Squeaky here
Hi, thanks for the note you left me regarding my article on Bridget Taylor. A few points if I may. I'm new to this so I'm not really good at. I don't think you hate me and I see how much obviously better the article is with your edits. So I'm actually grateful. You are really good at this, I'm not but I'd like to learn. So seeing the changes that you made to my original, I can't help but agree they improved the article, every one of them. So no complaints here.You have my thanks. Just to clear up a couple of kind of misconceptions. I really had no agenda. I don't know Bridget Taylor, I wasn't promoting her in the sense of I think she needs to be promoted. If I was promoting her it's more because I have become a huge user of wikipedia myself. It's become the first place I go to research any subject, person, place or thing. Given that, I totally respect the fact you are such a great editor. As a user of the information provided here, I also hope that the subject matter is comprehensive, fact filled, current, and factual. So again, I am not offended by the need for editing; rather I welcome it. Getting back to my agenda. I became aware of Bridget Taylor through a child with autism and did some research on her background. I found that she is widely considered to be the leading expert practicing the use of ABA therapy and that she is truly a tireless advocate for autistic children and adults. My sole agenda honestly was not to promote her but to have her listed in wikipedia. When the parents of child get the dreaded diagnosis of autism, they tend to search for everything and anything in their power to help their child. I've learned in my research that Taylor 's work and practice are of the utmost importance, especially to the parents of very young children first diagnosed. The Alpine Learning Group is arguably (but not many would argue the point) the best placement for an autistic child in the country. So given what I had learned from my research I just thought it was very important to growing segment of the population that Taylor just be listed in wikipedia. Honestly, I'm without agenda. In fact, I'm not a """"fan"""" of ABA therapy. It is, however, the only scientific method proven to help autisic children learn. Which is a valuable thing. A parent can use dietary supplements, adjunct therapies, etc. which I totally support. In the meantime while waiting to see the results, there is a small window of opportunity when a child's brain is still pliable and they are at their peak learning age. That window goes from maybe 3-6 years old. So, to me, it seems very important to use what we have available (ABA therapy) so that child, all autistic children make the strides they are able to make in lear",[],0
"""=Some small communist and fascist groups are definitely cults. Some larger ideological groups may contain a cultic core or special formations organized in a cult-like fashion (according to some accounts, the Third International operatives from various countries in the 1930s were treated virtually as cult zombies by Stalin's cynical bureaucrats). Arguably, Himmler's SS included cultic formations trained at that castle (Wewelsburg?) where they supposedly performed something called the ceremony of the stifling air (possibly this is a street legend). As to North Korea it is definitely a totalitarian state with an intense leader-cult religion (probably the most intense such formation that has ever existedone hesitates to describe it as a Stalin-style personality cult since even Stalin never strove for such a level of quasi-religious worship and regimentation).

 Requested move 

:Thompson people →  – This move was done by a speedy change, not by RM, with MOSTCOMMON and ENGLISH being used as the reasons.  But CANENGL applies on Canadian English articles on Canadian topics, and """"Nlaka'pamux"""" is now the standard in Canadian English, and like other indigenous endonyms in Canada is now the expected norm.  Unlike the parallel RMs at Lillooet people/St'at'imc and Chilcotin people/Tsilhqot'in, where there is a marked difference in google results, the difference in google results here is marginal, though still in favour of Nlaka'pamux, which gets 28,200 results vs for """"Thompson people"""" there are 28,000 - but a glance at the first page of that search demonstrates that not all of those are about these people.  I don't have t ime at the moment to search on media sources such as the Vancouver Sun or [http:thetyee.ca The Tyee], which are in British Columbia, or in the Globe and Mail....but I know the results will overwhelmingly favour """"Nlaka'pamux""""....as do the people themselves.

death to critics

So instead of  'every' earlier, now you are giving isolated cases, such as Theo van Gogh, Vincent van Gogh, Rashad Khalifa, and Irshad Manji who received death threats or were killed by anonymous unknown radicals.  What happened to every claim? Anyway, to prove your case that Islam sanctions death sentence to its critics, you can't just post the names of isolated cases where people received death threats from anonymous radicals! You need to post the names of prominent Islamic scholars and universities such as Al Azhar (not isolated radicals) who issued the death sentence against these people. The fatwa  against Rushdie was rejected by Al Azhar and all countries except Iran. So all you need to do is post Islamic sites (not anti-Islamic sites and isolated radical sites) who issued the death sentence against Menji, Rashad Khalifa, Theo van Gogh, etc. Bring your proof. Just throwing the names of isolated cases where someone received death threats from isolated anonymous radical doesn't prove Islam sanctions death sentence to it's critics! After 9/11, many Muslims and mosques received threats and some Muslims/Sikhs were even killed. That doesn't mean the US sanctions death to all American Muslims.  You are such a pathetic joke, dude!  Posting isolated cases where people received death threats from anonymous radicals doesn't prove a thing. We don't even know for sure who killed Rashad. You added even his name. You need to post the names of Muslim scholars who issues death sentence against, say, Rashad, Vincent van Gogg, and Menji. Then you need to post evidence that this was consensus among Muslim scholars on each of these cases.  Without that, you don't have any case, and you are refuted once again  09:33, 30 Nov 2004 (UTC)

I also provided examples of critics who were murdered by MUHAMMAD himself. Al-Azhar is not a higher authority than Muhammad.

No, you have only provided two stories in Ibn Ishaq about Muhammad that are rejected by Muslims, such as rejected here.  Al Azhar and Muslim scholars will interpret what Muhammad did and what Islamic law says, not an anti-Islamic bigot like you. You made a bold claim that in Islam critics are to be to be killed. I refuted that by giving examples that contradict that. You then claimed that every critic received a death sentence. You were refuted again. You then posted a list of isolated critics such as Rushdie, Menji, Rashad Khalifa, Theo van Gogh, etc, who received death threats from anonymous radicals. That's like posting (a much longer list) of Muslims/Sikhs who received death threats or were killed after 9/11, and claiming that American law allows Muslims to be killed. You were refuted again.  You need to provide names of prominent well known Muslim scholars (not anti-Islam sites or isolated radicals) for each of these cases and prove that they issued the death sentence. After that, you need to provide proof that that judgement was a consensus among Muslims scholars. You didn't do that. You were refuted once again. Since you are an anti-Islamic bigot, you can't just claim that Muhammad did this or that or Islamic law says this or that and expect that claim to be inserted in Encyclopedia. You need to provide proof. You couldn't because you were wrong. Try again, dude. You have failed quite miserably here  03:40, 1 Dec 2004 (UTC)

Furthermore, whe opinons of secular governments are irrelevant - of course Musilm countries rejected the death fatwa against Rushdie, but this was due to international politics, not due to religion. Also, as stated before, Ayatollah Khomenie was a Shiah CLERIC. The only way to be an Ayatollah is to be born as one. Aside from being the dictator or IRan, Khomenie was also the spiritial and religious leader of huge numbers of Sha'ias around the world. Khomenie wrote many fatwas and books about Islam. His most famous fatwa, of course, calls for the murder of Salman Rushdie. Now Al-Azhar - a SUNNI university  SUPPOSEDLY rejected KHomenei's teachings. This does not mean by any means prove that Al-Azhar was right, and Khomenie was wrong.

"Lana and Stephanie. 

Lana and Stephanie McMahon should stay in the main roster.

Lana is clearly feuding with Summer Rae, and everything is setting up for them to wrestle each other in either a singles or mixed tag match (with Ziggler and Rusev).

Stephanie is in the HHH category of saving his bullets for major feuds and angles, as she has wrestled the Bellas (with that feud main eventing Raw a couple of times last year), and has some business with Rhonda Rousey - which was set up last year at WrestleMania, and is rumored to culminate this year at Mania.

This is something relatively new in wrestling, where WWE is using people like Brock, Taker, Rock, Sting, HHH, and Stephanie in spurts for feuds leading up to major shows, then they disappear/fade into the background for awhile, and then they come back for their next feud/match, and so on, and so on.

Gotta have some wiggle room for stuff like this - no need to be so rigid.

I was wondering if we could have some references inserted after the second sentence of this article:
""""Ants evolved from wasp-like ancestors in the mid-Cretaceous period between 110 and 130 million years ago and diversified after the rise of flowering plants.""""
Also, perhaps this statement should begin with the words """"Many experts believe..."""" or """"Evidence suggests..."""" etc. etc. rather than making a statement of fact since this is not an established fact.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 62.6.149.18   
 This brings up a good point that many things are stated as fact when it comes to science.  I think that people are only careful to state things the way you describe for things that haven't been statistically proven, which points out several flaws in the statement.  Evolution is well enough established as well as ants evolving from wasps, but them first appearing the the mid-Cretaceous period is hard to statistically prove.  I suppose this should be changed if I'm right, but I may not be.   ~talk 
The Cretaceous period is not a short duration even on an evolutionary scale. The sentence might appear precise if used with some small unit of time but putting it at somewhere between 110 to 130 million years is not exactly being very precise nor does it appear to be an arrogant statement of the available evidence.

Hey, how is it going? I am kind of stuck with a question about the population of a small place, and as I know that you deal with unincorporated small places sometimes I thought to drop you a line. I started that article about Randolph, Tennessee recently and I am so far pretty amazed that there is a lot of documented historical information to find about that place. Funny, if enough time passes, even about the smallest places there is something to say. Well, what I could not find out about is any recent population. As a matter of fact, I have a referenced population for 1820 (54), shortly before foundation of the town. And I have one good enough estimate for 1834 (1,000). In 1861 they had 5,000 soldiers there, but that does not really count as population, does it? Today it might be in the few hundreds, not much more. It looks like any population more recent than 1834 would be of great help here already.

I tried to find out about the voting precincts, but Randolph is included in the same voting precinct (14 S.W. Tipton) with a few other, larger communities. So you can't really start from there.

 Less jargon 

This is a good article, but in a few sections there is too much aviation jargon or unexplained technical detail. For example, it refers to """"the high alpha needed at rotation"""". What is an alpha?  (What is rotation?).  As another example, there is no explanation (or citation...) of the following statement: """"63% of the aircraft's thrust is attributed to the intakes whilst the exhaust nozzles generate 29% and the engines just 8% of the thrust"""". What is a non-aviation reader to make of this statement? How can the engines only produce 8% of the thrust?

I just offer these two examples; there are a few others. Can someone please look through the article and make the needed edits? I don't think it will be a lot of work.  """,[],0

"Hello, the Heleen Mees article is now full of nonsense. Mees never was an employee of the european Commission, the 2006 article about women (not) working was not her first article in NRC Handelsblad. She had published quite a bit before that. Also, the article includes vicious and superfluous references to the stalking charges that are set for dismissal and is quite unbalanced. The following would be a much better text:

Heleen Mees (born Heleen Nijkamp, 1968, Hengelo)[1] is a Dutch opinion writer, economist and lawyer. She has been credited as being a third wave feminist.[3]

Biography
Mees graduated in Economy and Law at University of Groningen. From 1992 to 1998, Mees worked for the Dutch Treasury in The Hague. From 1998 to 2000 Mees worked as a national expert for the European Commission in Brussels.[5] In 2000 she emigrated to the USA, where she changed her surname to Mees.[6] Mees lives in Brooklyn, New York.[2]
Mees' breakthrough as an opinion writer in the Netherlands came in 2006 when she wrote The time is long overdue that women should go to work.[8] That same year, she co-founded Women on Top, an organization that until 2011 advocated more women in top jobs.[9] 
From 2006 to 2010 Mees wrote a bi-weekly column in NRC Handelsblad, and from 2012 to 2013 for Het Financieele Dagblad. Her work has been published in the Financial Times, Foreign Policy and other international newspapers. Currently she is a columnist for Project Syndicate[11] and the German magazine Capital. Mees is the author of three books. 
Mees has been president of the New York chapter of the Dutch Labour Party (PvdA) in New York. In 2008, she worked as a volunteer for the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton.[12]
In August 2012, Mees completed a doctoral thesis at the Erasmus School of Economics, focusing on the effect of China's economy on the emergence of the 2008 global financial crisis.[13] While completing her research, she worked as an Adjunct Assistant Professor at Tilburg University.[14] From September 2012 until July 2013, Mees was employed as an Adjunct Associate Professor of Public Administration at New York University's Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service.[15]
In July 2013, Mees was arrested in New York on charges of stalking her former lover, the chief economist of Citigroup, Willem Buiter.[16] In March 2014, the court decided that the case against Mees was to be dismissed in one year provided that she complies with two conditions.[17]",[],0

whatever....I did NOT say I would edit war, in fact I said I would be careful NOT actually edit war, but to simply place a word that belongs in the article, that Nova keeps having issues with.   Are you saying that I don't have the right in the """"future"""" to ever put in anything simply cuz Nova would object?     My hands would have to be tied, you're saying??

I don't like how you jumped the gun and twisted what I said around, where I specifically said I would NOT """"edit war"""", but would not put up with suppression of facts, simply cuz Nova doesn't like them. Also, the """"personal attacks"""" are merely facts about this individual that can be easily looked up. I'm not the only one who doesn't like him or what he does.    Actually at this point I don't care...I'm tired of the insanity.....I have other things to do, and this nonsense is too time-consuming anyway.  For real.   This person Nova made it """"personal"""" long before I did, with his actions.    Again, there are others who feel the same way....  I'm not the only one he's upset with his constant edit warring and disrespect.  So you looking only at me, and misunderstanding my words and my intent.    I was seriously planning to be done with Wikipedia for a long while anyway. (I have other accounts and even other IPs anyway.....but I probably won't even use them, as I don't really care to be wasting time on this stuff, anymore.)  Nova has no business on Wikipedia. He's an insufferable joke.  And I don't care that it's a personal attack. Since I'm blocked anyway, I might as well make it worth it.   He should just get lost from all articles, he adds nothing but aggravation and a barrage of insanity.    

Again, I'm NOT the only one who's been a victim of his crazy nonsense.    Yet that nutball stays unblocked, yet he is the CAUSE of it all the problems.    Interesting.  As I said, whatever.....I contributed a lot to WP in 5 short months (my first edit in Feb 2008 does not count, as that was just playing around....I got serious with WP in February 2010....)....with meaningful additions, corrections, source editing, vandalism removal, grammar correction, section adding, creation of a few articles.....etc.   I never even intended to get into this, it was all an accident when I couldn't find some topics on WP that I thought would be, so I decided to create some articles....and then get caught up in this stuff.   Much to my chagrin.   I have better (for real) things to do.    I don't care that much that I'm blocked......but it's the principle that it's sort of unfair, and you misunderstand (and actually twisted) my words around.....and this maniac (more personal attacks, so I'm making it good) gets off basically scott-free.......EVEN THOUGH I CAN SHOW YOU EXAMPLES OF WHERE HE'S BEEN AN INSUFFERABLE TARD WITH OTHER PEOPLE TOO.    You'll overlook that of course.     Cuz Nova knows how to manipulate WP and WP Admins fairly well, I've noticed.    Though I know that some Admins see his nonsense too.    

Anyway, again.....to re-iterate.....I did not say I would """"edit war"""" but would simply exercise my rights to put in words in an article, despite Nova's own constant edit warring and neurotic objections to everything.    And I said I would be careful NOT to violate 3RR as well as NOT brazenly """"edit war"""".     Of course you see it as a threat to """"edit war"""" anyway...

Also, as I don't need the money, I have not been doing what authors usually do to promote their books. I am too busy creating new content right now. Remember I am in Star Trek and on some major TV Shows and on IPOD Radio with RU Sirius and will be doing more of that bye and bye. If I wanted to go the usual route I could.

 Michael Wainer 

Ms. Gale,

We here at 13MUSIC have repeatedly attempted to create a wiki page for our artist, producer and industry phenom, Michael Wainer.  Wiki has repeatedly deleted this entry.  I have found numerous examples of musicians, actors and such with a fraction of Mr. Wainer's success undeleted and untagged on Wikipedia.

Mr. Wainer has not only co-written and produced 6 Billboard-charting musical compositions for artists from Foxy Brown to Sean """"Diddy"""" Combs (many of which I am positive you have heard), but has also played an integral role in the digital development of MTV's URGE online music delivery system and is the co-founder and guitarist in the band 13.  13 is the first band to be signed to music icon, LL Cool J's, new production label.  13 will be releasing a full length, major-label release in 2008 followed by an international tour. 

I am sure I do not have to tell you how significant any one of these achievements are individually, let alone all achieved by one 25 year old young man.

Wikipedia is an excellent and innovative tool and resource for our industry and our fan base and I implore you, on behalf of Mr. Wainer and his countless fans, to restore the page which our PR manager, Mr. Lust, uploaded today.  We have provided references, links and a full bio yet still have had no success.

Dear Alexikoua, I am wondering whether there is any informative value in citing the so-called """"1910 census"""". This is not an official census, it belongs to a series of documents that had propaganda value, in the sense that it was createed in 1919 to help the Greek delegation persuade other participants in the peace conference to yield to its demands and maximize Greek territorial gains in Asia Minor.

I would also be thankful if you could please provide your source for the numbers you cite in the 1914 Ottoman census table. The reason I am asking is that I have Karpat's book right in front of me and some of the numbers differ somewhat. For example, Greeks of Adana vilayet amount to 8,537 in Karpat (1985), pp. 172, 188, not 12,000.

Finally, I would like to add a word of caution, if I may: as I found out reading a note in Kostopoulos, Tasos (2007) Polemos kai ethnokatharse, p. 171 [I can confirm this in a couple of days by comparing Karpat's book, pp. 170-189 and Alexandris, Alexis (1999) """"The Greek census of Anatolia and Thrace (1910-1912): a contribution to Ottoman Historical Demography"""" in D. Gondicas - Ch Issawi (eds.), Ottoman Greeks in the age of nationalism, Princeton, pp. 58-65] despite having the same name, the boundaries of vilayets vary between Ottoman censuses and that of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, the 1914 census not including certain sanjaks, like Kutahya, Afion Karahisan, Canik (=Samsun), Eskisehir etc, in vilayets. For these minor, but existing nonetheless discrepancies between the two to be eradicated, it is advisable to adjust one of the two administrative divisions to the other's a model being provided by Kostopoulos, (2009), pp. 170-1.

Pointing out that some people behave like this (backed up with reliable reports of such behavour) seems to be a valid part of this article, even if the label 'false skeptic' is confusing.  (edits) 

1.In your view and others yes. But there are others who view false as the opposite of truth as it is meant to be. Granted """" Nothing can be so completly itself that it does not contain something of its opposite."""" -Lao Tzu For the sake of argument false is not true. You are all opinion, though ultimately we all are. Either way, the majority opinion of """"false"""" is """"not true""""; pseudo. Therefore, to claim someone is a false skeptic is impossible since you can't prove if your view, let alone theres, is 100% and knows what """"true"""" skepticism is.= The logicians call this quite often the """"TRUE SCOTSMAN FALLACY"""". 2. We could all form websites, talk bs, and then use it or our friends as """"sources"""". The trouble is not in the getting of the source, but in the quality therein. Your view and sources lack quality and are not worthy of Wiki...particularly when applied to such a grand and ancient pylosophical view as Skepticism. For example; """"I know more than the average man in that I know that I know nothing.""""-Socrates . I believe he is saying that one can't know anything for certain and that this truth is the only real knowledge he has thus giving him an advantage that may not be there; a lovely paradox. Most view this statement to be that there is too much knowledge for one to know and that knowing this paradoxilly makes him wiser in his lack of wisdom. HOWEVER, you don't see me going to the page on Socrates, finding bs sources that support my rare view, and forcing hundreds of viewers in the future to be subject to my minority and severly lacking of analysis viewpoint, do you?

 NPOV dispute

In my interpretation, the early October version of this article was rewritten with a load of weasle words which downplay criticm of the phrase's usage, and subtly play up the dubious narrative genre. More mention of the possibility that the narrative genre is disinformation is needed. The article should be explicitly clear that labeling an allegation a """"conspiracy theory"""" is an attempt at dubiousness through association with the narrative genre. Also, """"generally and """"commonly considered"""" in the intro are incomplete and need to be fixed for NPOV.

If correct, this seems normal to me. Armed police are not common, even in London.

Page Rebuild

For quite some time, the Alcoholism entry has provided out of date or incorrect information. I'm in the process of rewriting it to meet contemporary scientific standards for the disease. I welcome external review and discussion. 
 Stuart Gitlow MD (Chief, Annenberg Physician Training Program in Addictive Disease, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, NYC)

Thanks for your contributions so far.  You may be interested in creating a user account.  Some of the benefits are discussed at this page: Wikipedia:Why_create_an_account%3F  

It greatly reduces the chances people will revert your changes, for one thing. -)  

Good points, and I've created an account as you suggest. See my notes below as well. sg

In response to the commentary at the very, very bottom of this page (dupe social impacts), I've rearranged the content of the page a bit.  I believe that it now better reflects the chronology of how people are impacted by alcoholism, and therefore reflects the order in which this information becomes important to people: definition, effects, diagnoses, treatment, broader issues.

FYI, I renamed the first instance of Social Issues to read """"Societal Issues"""" and moved it into the broader issues area.  I moved the latter one up to become a subheading of the """"Effects"""" category.  After this edit I'm going to go remove the original note of this (because it's no longer germain), so you'll have to look at the next edit in order to read it.  

In looking over the article and the discussion of Stanton Peele's perspective et al, I'm wondering whether some of the ongoing discussion held on this page is about a misconception that alcoholism is equal to """"excessive drinking,"""" whatever that is. Alcoholism doesn't refer to someone who drinks a lot. Many people drink a great deal but aren't alcoholic. Conversely, many alcoholics don't drink very much at all compared against the general population's intake.  

The section on """"terminology"""" that you removed was intended to address exactly this misunderstanding.  Since you seem to think it's important, I'm putting it back in.  

righto 

Despite the difficulties that we've had of late, the entry is coming together nicely. I'm looking over the EFFECTS section, which has a good deal of information on alcohol itself, and the impact of alcohol USE. It is difficult to tease out the effects of alcoholism versus the effects of alcohol. The effects of alcoholism when an alcoholic is in recovery, for example, would be different from the effects of alcoholism while an individual is drinking on a daily basis. (This is similar, of course, to the situation with other diseases - the effects of diabetes when an individual has well-controlled blood glucoses are different from the effects of untreated diabetes). Nevertheless, I wonder whether the entire section would be more appropriately found in the alcohol article rather than here in the alcoholism article. Can we build a consensus regarding this area?  

 Alcoholism vs. Alcohol abuse 

The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism make a difference between one and the other. What I found more confusing is that from """"alcohol abuse"""" you're redirected to """"alcoholism"""".

""""Alcoholism, also known as 'alcohol dependence,' is a disease that includes four symptoms: craving, loss of control, physical dependence, and tolerance"""". 

Moreover, """"Alcohol abuse differs from alcoholism in that it does not include an extremely strong craving for alcohol, loss of control over drinking, or physical dependence"""", etc etc.

>> Getting the facts @ NIAAA

 

Response:  Good point.  From one interested perspective, AA literature itself discusses this issue and draws a clear distinction between alcohol abuse and alcoholism. 

I can't make the correction. I'm not that good informed and my english is quite lousy. Could you..?

This was added from the same book: After the Battle of Manzikert (1071), Greek populations of Anatolia were ethnically cleansed by nomadic Seljuk Turks

But the original sentence in the book was:[1]
The ethnic cleansing of sedentary Greek population of Anatolia by nomadic Seljuk Turks after the Battle of Manzikert in 1071.

If Levounion is copyright violation than this is also.

The idea that Seljuk Turks ethnically cleansed Anatolia is not true, Anatolian Greek populations survived till 1922, the Population exchange between Greece and Turkey.

Claiming Seljuks ethnically cleansed Anatolia is historically incorrect, it had a multicultural population, besides Seljuks had a sedentary state Seljuk Empire,  besides this claim was based upon one source, which was added by cherry picking and snippet abuse.

Yes, you have time to edit-war and restore the article to promotional version but not to edit to correct it. When corrected by some other editor, you claim it not to be perfect and do revert repeatedly. I see no good in promotional and unsourced tone and contents based purely on primary source.

Edit-warring? Did I make any edit without leaving an edit summary? It is you, despite discussing the concerns on here, you went on to make revert multiple times. I'm very much disappointed to see apparently an established editor behaving, yes, much likely to a WP:NOTHERE editor. It is you, who chooses to revert instead discussing the changes.

You did not answer one previous question. Have you some 'conflict of interest' with the subject? And, the headline of the discussion is very much appropriate. You see good in 'promotional contents either unsourced or dependent of primary sources', and claim it to be encyclopedic. Is it really what you understand of encyclopedic contents?

"A Short History of Republican Sinn Féin  

In 1902, Arthur Griffith, Editor of the United Irishman, presented to the third annual convention of Cumann na nGaedheal the most revolutionary political idea since the fall of Parnell; it was that the elected Irish Members of Parliament should refuse to sit in Westminster, demand reinstitution of the Irish Parliament of 1782, and pledge allegiance only to a king of Ireland, not to the King of England. While the Liberator, Daniel O’Connell, had once considered such unilateral action, he had not forced the issue. Griffith provided a strategy of passive resistance by turning an assembly of Irish MPs into a de facto constitutional convention. Modeled on Frank Deak’s policy, which resulted in the Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary in 1867, Griffith serialized his abstentionist program in the United Irishman as the Resurrection of Hungary, and then published it as a pamphlet and distributed it widely in 1904. The direct result of this idea was the formation of Sinn Féin on 28th November 1905, as an abstentionist political party, with internal self-reliance as its principal plank, pledging never to recognize or use the services or forces of the enemy. The founders of Sinn Féin were Arthur Griffith, Seán T. O’Kelly, Bulmer Hobson, Countess Markiewicz and Seán Mac Diarmada. In addition to contesting a Parliamentary election in North Lietrim in 1908, Sinn Féin was also active locally, electing a number of men to county councils and other local bodies. 

Historian, lecturer, Conradh na Gaeilge president and Radio Free Éireann (public service broadcasting, 99.5 FM in New York) commentator Nollaig Ó Gadhra points out that the big change in Sinn Féin came in the Árd Fheis of 1917, when the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) under the guidance of Michael Collins and the Irish Volunteers under Cathal Brugha, caused Sinn Féin to change its policy from monarchist to republican abstention. After the Rising, Sinn Féin adopted an election manifesto for all elections, insisting upon the Irish Republic Proclaimed on Easter Monday, 1916. Éamonn deValera, campaigning in an Irish Volunteer uniform, was elected for East Clare in June 1917. At the Árd Fheis of Sinn Féin in October 1917, Arthur Griffith graciously stepped down from President to Vice President of Sinn Féin, to allow the election of deValera, who, after the death on hunger strike of Thomas Ashe, was the senior surviving Commandant from 1916. 

This was the Sinn Féin which contested the general election of 14 December 1918, promising to NOT represent their constituents or their country in the mighty Westminster Parliament in London, but rather to set up, without foreign let or hindrance, a Republican assembly which would form an Irish government for Ireland. Sinn Féin won over 79% of the popular vote in all Ireland, and 73 of 105 seats, in what can only be described as a plebiscite for independence. The delegates who assembled in the Mansion House in Dublin formed the First Dáil Éireann and issued the Irish Declaration of Independence on 21 January 1919 (legally the equivalent of the American Declaration of Independence by the Second Continental Congress, promulgated on the 4th of July 1776). That Easter Monday, 1916 is regarded as the significant date is a consequence of the pre-existing Army Council of the Irish Republican Army – Óglaigh na hÉireann (the IRA) insisting upon the First Dáil Éireann recognizing the Irish Republic proclaimed in arms in 1916, as a condition for the IRA coming under the authority of the government formed by the First Dáil Éireann. [See also Dorothy Macardle, The Irish Republic (New York, 1965).] 

The democratic voice of the Irish people had spoken (vox populi, vox Dei), and their elected representatives sought the recognition of their national self-determination as promised by American President Woodrow Wilson’s Fourteen Points, on which basis the Armistice ending the Great War on 11 November 1918, had been accepted by the Central Powers. Ireland was denied recognition and a seat at the Versailles peace conference. The ensuing conflict between the forces of the Imperial Government in London and the Irish Republic has become known to history as the “Black and Tan War” (1919-1921). But, the military lessons of Dublin 1916 having been studied in the internment camp of Frongoch, the forces of the Irish Republic waged an asymmetrical conflict against the alien forces of occupation. Modern guerilla warfare entered on to the twentieth century. England, though still in control of many strong points, could no longer coerce Ireland into remaining peacefully within her empire. A Second (Republican) Dáil Éireann came together in August 1921 (124 Sinn Féin and 4 Unionist members). Nollaig Ó Gadhra, in Civil War in Connacht (Cork & Dublin: Mercier Press, 1999), points out that the Sinn Féin delegates regarded their mandate to be as Teachta Dála Éir",[],0

Here is the problem that I have with this. They built a structure before Benjamin Franklin. Nowhere in my own indepdnent research is there any substantiative proof that contends that when this tower was built in Russia, it was specificially intended to strike lightning.

Clearly, the policy change from using to not using a colon was therefore initiated with the release of Star Trek Generations and Wikipedia should reflect this. Another consideration is that if the title of this article """"Star Trek Into Darkness"""" is going to stay this way (which, btw, I support and find sensible), there will be an inconsistency in the titling of movie articles, because one article (this one) would use the titling as in the official source, whereas the other(s) would use titling according to Wikipedian style rules.

 I reverted it back because I preferred the original version before Rod Ball's edits.  I asked if anyone else agreed with Rod Ball on this issue - having gotten no response, I assumed that other people either didn't care, or like me preferred the original.  In addition, I believe that Pjacobi already reverted these particular edits once.

 So I'll ask again - does anybody agree with Rod Ball on this issue, and actually prefer his version?  I like it the way it is now.  To make it less personal, do people like http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bell%27s_spaceship_paradox&oldid;=79349924 or http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bell%27s_spaceship_paradox&oldid;=79587575

 I think that """"a family of paradoxes"""" is more technically accurate, if you re-read the literature section you'll see why Hillman (the originator of this wording) described them this way.  Different authors have analyzed slightly different situations using different means.

 I also think accelerated rods are quite relevant and related (again, I borrowed this from Hillman, though I added the wiki-link to Born rigid motion).  Note that we are currently arguing accelerated motion with Rod Ball.  I would say that the topic is therfore closely related, though not identical.  That's just what the intro says.  Strings and spaceships share much of the same physics as rods and spaceships, in the final analysis.  It's fundamentally about distance.

 I think both versions contain equivalent information in explaining why the paradox, originated by Dewan and Beran, is named after Bell.   """,[],0

Also, I disagree with adding a mention of Crunchyroll to the main page (it's mentioned on the lists' pages which is enough) and his retitling of everything to match with Crunchyroll (several of those translations are just incorrect) but I don't think you should necessarily revert those. I will deal with them later, or I could get 's attention and tell him there's no reason to change the translations like that because I've already said below that Crunchyroll is getting everything wrong, at least with the change of """"The Warrior Returning to the Wind"""" to """"The Warrior of Wind"""".

I'm reinstating the above edit by """"Br'er Bear"""", which was reverted by Gogo Dodo. Yes, Br'er Bear is a sock of a blocked user, but I don't see the need to be formalistic about that on this page. (I'm on board with reverting the Br'er Bear edits on other pages, naturally.) That was obviously Br'er Rabbit editing his own talkpage, which is not something he has been blocked from. He wasn't abusing or attacking anybody, he was making a request. (And sort of making a point/saying goodbye after all these years, but why shouldn't he, on his own page?) I'm assuming he has scuttled the Br'er Rabbit account, along with the German fleet, so that he wasn't able to use that to make the request. 
@Gogo Dodo: I know what a good guy you are, I would never think you reverted the edit in order to humiliate and punish the user. But that's the only actual effect the deletion has that I can see. I won't restore it again if you revert me, but please let it be.
@Jack: I'll have to think about your request, since all those user talkpages are a problem. Most of them will probably just be undeleted again if I do delete them. I can blank them, of course. 

Br'er Bear's edit originally appeared immediately below my own post above, so I take his request as made to me, but I guess it's better to move it down here in order to start a new thread.  | talk .""",[],0

However, Starcade, I think the most productive thing you can do right now is tasking yourself with finding a reliable source that back up the edits you're trying to make.  We have a policy, which can be seen at WP:BURDEN, that says The burden of evidence lies with the editor who adds or restores material. You may remove any material lacking a reliable source that directly supports it. Wikipedia requires that things be proven with reliable sources. If you can find a reliable source that backs up your information, that will solve all of this and would most likely allow the inclusion of the information in the article.  I think that should be your top priority regarding the article.  Thank you. - Ghost 

Second half, Sudoghost:  I had done so beforehand.  I guess I should back up and explain the whole thing.

The dispute is about the scheduling of matches on Wrestlemania XXVIII.  The original list had one match, The Rock vs. John Cena, which was agreed to in a promo the Monday after Wrestlemania XXVII, the first time such a thing had been done that far in advance.

Fast forward to July 17, 2011, where Daniel Bryan, largely seen as a too-small wrestler with no personality in a federation trying to distance itself from """"wrestling"""", won the Smackdown Money in the Bank Ladder Match.  This won him, in storyline, the unilateral right to a WWE World Heavyweight Championship match at any point over the next year.  Last Friday (aired  it actually was taped on Tuesday), he announced that he would cash in that title opportunity at Wrestlemania XXVIII.  http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2011-07-22/results was the source I used.  WWE also has an interview up with Bryan now which was not up when I made the edit.

My issue is that, since the Money in the Bank winner can choose to cash his briefcase any time, he had chosen to do so at Mania XXVIII  and at that moment, became a scheduled match for WrestleMania XXVIII.  Ruth is using the Mr. Kennedy situation to claim that match probably will not take place (Kennedy (now Mr. Anderson, a previous MitB winner, wanted to do the same thing (cash at Wrestlemania), but was quickly unseated by Edge, cancelling that match).  The problem with this is two-fold:  One, it presumes (WP:Crystal, again!) that Bryan will, because he is not seen favorably by Vince McMahon (nor by many WWE marks), lose not only his briefcase but his real-life place on the WWE roster by Mania XXVIII.  Two, if me putting that match up is WP:Crystal, then so, at this early date, is Rock-Cena.  Ruth claims she has WWE travel packages which have already advertised Rock-Cena for Mania XXVIII, but has consistently refused to reference them.  She claims exactly what JaC stated above as sufficient to not only keep Rock-Cena, but remove Bryan from the card AND silence me from saying otherwise!

So I went to the WP:Crystal page and applied the relevant clause. Individual scheduled or expected future events should only be included if the event is notable and almost certain to take place. Dates are not definite until the event actually takes place. If preparation for the event is not already in progress, speculation about it must be well documented.  The event, by the WWE Universe, is notable (it's a Smackdown main event for the largest card of the year for the company), is at least as certain to take place (at the moment) as Rock-Cena (and if that fact changes, we can change the Mania XXVIII page when it does), and the documentation is on WWE's own website, which I provided you.

I believe Ruth is a typical WWE mark, like this other *mumblemumblemumble* up here, and believes that Daniel Bryan is not worthy of even a WWE contract.  I believe her stand is prejudicial, selective, and wrong.  Good faith went out the door about 15 posts ago.  And I do NOT believe in consensus if the consensus is demonstratably wrong!   """,[],0

The addition does meet your requirements.  The bass player from The Steadys (Ani Schempfe a.k.a. DJ On-E) joined the pop group Dee-Lite in 1993 after The Steadys broke up.  This fits with you requirements if I'm not mistaken.  The Steadys are also on a live album called NYC SKA LIVE which was released in 1990, so there is physical proof (Recorded media) and this I believe also fits your requirements.  Thank you!

"""[outdent]David,  I have tried in the nicest possible way to tell you that the majority of the text you are so set on using is not suitable as an encyclopaedia article. Copyvio or no, anything that builds up to soliciting money and indeed actually explicitly  requests  donations going so far as to give the bank details is not going to last five minutes. If all the time an effort you have expended trying to get the copyvio undeleted had instead been spent pulling together a new article it would all be done and dusted by now. I repeat my previous advice: base an article on Sport England. 

I'm also not sure whether you have been following the conversation on George's talk if not you might consider hopping over there as my question has been answered and it has been confirmed that as far as Wikipedia is concerned the text is still not released to GFDL. You'll also notice that your conflict of interest has been raised as a concern; personally I think that it is manageable, although Wikipedia does generally discourage people from editing on subjects they are personally connected with as we recognise that this does make it hard to remain neutral. The general rule of thumb is that if a topic is notable enough for inclusion then likely an uninvolved editor will be along soon enough to create an article about it. 

On the question of the image. I presume from looking at your talk page that you are referring to the (separately deleted) logo. This is entirely separate from the article and from reading what George says I understand that you have released it under GFDL. I would first ask you to think again very carefully about the implications of this as usually logos remain copyrighted and are used under a strict fair-use rationale. It is rarer than hens teeth that any organisation would relinquish their rights to their own logo/identity and release it for others to do with what they wish - are you confident for example that your board properly understand what this means and are entirely comfortable with it? However, if this really is the case then all you need to do is upload it (by clicking """"Upload file"""" on the menu on the left) making sure that you attribute the correct licensing and source information - the upload page will walk you through this. 

Finally on a housekeeping note could I ask that you not start a new thread every time you post here on this subject. You'll see that I have been moving your posts up under the one heading to keep the conversation together. Cheers,  talk

My point, which I made here on Krill’s talk page, is that I have made many, conflict-free contributions to MOSNUM on issues not related to date linking.

You and Your Uncivil Friends Refuted

Your Uncivil Friends Refuted

Or were you saying something to the over 300 people who've downloaded this refutation of you're lies?:

http://www.mininova.org/tor/1264745

And so that everyone can see part of it here:

JoshuaZ said:

""""Starfire, as I tried to explain to you Wikipedia cares about reliable sources and verifiability, not truth. Now, if you read that guideline, you may understand why in general AIG and many of the other sources you used are not reliable sources.""""

Hey JoshuaZ the liar, where does Wikipedia's policy say that AnswersInGensis.org is not a reliable source? Where JoshuaZ the vandal and liar? Show us. So you think saying, """"Now"""" is scientific evidence that you are a wise and intelligent teller of the truth or that you know what a reliable and verifiable source is?

JoshuaZ, where does Wikipedia's policy say that the Jacob Sheep Association = a reliable and verifiable source that Jacob Sheep are biologically primitive you hypocrite? Explain that hypocrite who personally attacked Starfire777 using lies.

Show your references JoshuaZ. Saying, """"Now"""" is not a reference that your accusations are true are they? Why can't you make sense Joshua?

Again, where did those verses prophecy anything? Do these look like prophecies JoshuaZ?:

Joshua also said:

""""In this case, they did have sources, so you have even less of an argument.""""

Wrong JoshuaZ. Simply citing sources as you yourself said does not make the source valid. It must be substantiated and verifiable. Why do you conveniently forget that you smug babbling hypocrite?

Your later comments don't merit much of a response, but I wThen he said:

""""ill simply note that accusing people of bigotry, bias, hypocrisy, irrationality and trolling makes my earlier comment about not using """"Darwinist"""" as a slur somewhat irrelevant;""""

Because you said so JoshuaZ, and whatever you said is true is true because you said so. So much for references eh? All you have to do is accuse and it makes you right, right hypocrite? See how you go round and round in circles using circular reasoning?

""""if your earlier comment toed the line, the one above crosses it.""""

Because you said so JoshuaZ, and whatever you say is true because you said so. Science!

""""I suggest you calm down""""

I suggest you not use sarcastic insults like that, ok hypocrite? You're implying that the Starfire777 is ill-tempered merely because he points out that you are hypocrite and uses logic to do so (as well as verifiable references on Answersingenesis.com which you lied about not being reliable and being against Wikipedia's rules to cite), ok liar?

I suggest you also not command a Christian to follow your moral standards over Christ's, over God's. He is a Christian don't ya know? Are you now God to tell him how to feel and think? I suggest you read this verse and take it to heart which millions of Christians know very well so that you learn how not to offend them again:

""""Be angry and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger, and give no opportunity to the devil."""" - Ephesians 4:26-27

Last time I checked JoshuaZ, neither your nor Wikipedia's rules superceded God's. 

""""and read the relevant Wikipedia policies and guidelines while you wait for your block to expire.""""

Oh the old """"you need to read it but I don't"""" and """"you sit and think while your grounded young man"""" insults. What an arrogant, childish hypocrite you are.

I suggest that you stop pretending that whatever you say is true merely because you said it, and again, learn what Starfire777 properly told you to learn.

I'll enhance the list for you:

Reference, evidence, truth, reality, lie, bigot, hypocrite, fallacy, circular reasoning, troll, stalking, harassment, insults, hatred, and love.

""""This is in addition to issues of original research in regard to Biblical prophecies and other issues on the Charles Darwin page.""""

"Raymond arritt

This is not an accident 

Some of the sections/articles on Kambojas, as being edited and altered by Debachmann, are getting utterly confusing and more messier, and, I'm afraid, may lead to erroneous conclusions by the readers. As he has started editing/altering them en mass, either he should improve the articles by editing them suitably so as to keep them clear, logical and readable and at the same time, also maintain/keep intact their integrity and factuality (let's us if he can do it), or else, I will have no alternative except to revert them back to their original versions. For example, the article Language and ethnicity of Kambojas, in its current form which he has edited, is utterly terrible. I don't think he and other editors on kamboj articles of his kind are quite familiar with the Kamboj history, so as to render them a justice. Further, please make a note that, none of the information, in any of articles on the Kambojas, is a original-research as Mr Debachmann continues to allege. All the Kamboj information is in the books and only he and other people of his ilk may not be aware of it. I have sent this note to him not with any intention to enter into a futile argument with him, but simply to let him know that all the information on the Kambojas..ancient/mediaval or modern, as inserted in any Kamboj related article here, is well-documented and has been taken from reliable references/sources from notable scholars.

""":Hi. Lots of points, I'll reply as best I can:
Listing the squadrons and their aircraft types is too much /for this article/ but not too much for Wikipedia. Only listing the serial numbers, pilots or other minutiae is too much for Wikipedia. One way you could try would be to create a """"sandbox"""" page for yourself, say User:FFA P-16/Sandbox, write up the squadrons as best you can and then ask at Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Aircraft‎ if we can look at it, tidy up the English, etc. and advise on the best page to put it on. Ground instruction airframes are not notable unless there is some special reason, for example if the airframe itself is notable from earlier in its life. 
Re. the ordering of the list, I would have to think about that but it is really a separate discussion. 
You say that the serial numbering (tail numbering) uses a special system. I would like to see this system explained, but it needs just a few examples to show the principles, not the whole list.
If Swiss writers routinely quote the serial number of an aircraft when writing about it, as a way of showing the information contained in the number, then you should be able to reference this. Such references might convince us that the Swiss Air Force is an exception to the general rule. We Wikipedia editors do like to see hard evidence, not just another editor's word. And, as you have noticed, we sadly know little of the Swiss Air Force unless someone can find reliable sources for us. — Cheers,  (Talk)

"NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL FROM WIKIPEDIA 

I am writing this message to you as a notice of my withdrawal from Wikipedia following the recent events/edits on the CNN and Susan Roesgen pages – events that you were involved in.  Never in all of my years in academia (the better part of a decade) have I been privy to such patently-insincere and downright academically-fraudulent work as that which I have encountered on Wikipedia.
While I was initially willing to set aside all of the negative things I had heard about Wikipedia in an effort to contribute to a seemingly beneficial project, the actions of editors and administrators on the  Susan Roesgen and CNN pages has made it eminently clear that “scholarship” and Wikipedia truly are mutually exclusive – propaganda has carried the day.
My failure to grace the project with some actual academically-sound work was not made in vain, however; with every neutral editor that you drive out of the project with your blatantly POV-pushing agenda, you further bolster your reputation as nothing but an unreliable propaganda board. Your reputation for unreliability was perhaps best captured in a recent statement made by my corporations professor: “I decided to make myself more ignorant on the topic by looking at the article (Dodge v. Ford Motor Company) on Wikipedia.”
I strongly encourage you to alter your course, set aside your agenda, and reverse your – and Wikipedia’s – reputation as a laughing stock. This will not only benefit the public in general, but will, I submit, actually make you feel better about yourself. Best, J.M.",[],0

The only rule I know is that I try to treat others as I would have them treat me. If someone wants to talk to me, I will act like an adult and listen to them and they can post anything they like. I would prefer they not use expletives, but my skin is very thick. It is imperative that people be allowed to notifiy others of a desire for a serious and frank and open discussion in a public forum. Where is that forum on WP if not on the user page either his or mine. How are we to have a meeting of minds if I cannot at least invite him to such an honest discussion?

How does that work?

 Greece an eastern culture? 
In what logic Greece is put into """"EASTERN CULTURES"""" ? Based on geography, religion , cultural or racial isssues? I am waiting an answer. Why the term greek in anal sex is not considered by wikipedia a slur? The described reasons about having anal sex before wedding are relevant for muslims, not christians, if you have any sense of reality (and credibility)

man, what are you talking about? greece is of course comparably eastern with respect to west europe.. its history is rooted in east, as a race greek nation is genetically similar to turks, and christianity does not mean the west automatically.. this is not the page to discuss where greece belongs..
and any sense of reality and credibility offers that anal sex is forbidden by majority of sects of all monotheistic religions.. don't try to reflect all christians are welcoming anal sex, while all muslims are completely against it, there are muslim sects who don't condone anal sex...  

 Patently false statement 
For women, pleasure is derived from anal intercourse because the rectum shares a wall with the vagina and therefore shares some of the nerve endings associated with sexual pleasure.

This is wrong anatomically and factually  most women do not find anal sex pleasurable, according to surveys by Kinsey and others.  Any statement to the contrary should be quantified somehow.

 The entire opening section of this article does not have a neutral POV.  Rather, it verges on arguments in favor of anal sex and clearly favors a male's perspective.  This seems to violate the official NPOV stance.

 Claiming that """"most women do not find it pleasurable"""" is POV and unverifiable. What is verifiable is that heterosexual couples do indeed practice it (survey mentioned in 4th link below), and that some females find it pleasurable and can achieve orgasm. The presense of nerve endings in the areas described is also verifiable.

It isn't really unverifiable, most women do not enjoy anal sex as is shown in consistent studies.  Whether that is based on anatomical reasons or social reasons is not really important to whether or not it is a fact.  It could be mentioned that most women do not enjoy anal sex, but some do.  It should also be mentioned that many heterosexual couples do engage in anal sex (and if anyone doesn't understand how most women can dislike anal sex and then a large number of them can participate in it, they don't know very much about women).

 Let's see some of those """"consistent studies."""" Talk 

If the wording is the main issue under debate, then why not simply say that women can find anal sex pleasurable, as opposed to categorically stating we do or don't, because that's more a matter of preference than anything else.

According to data released earlier this year by the Centers for Disease Control, the probability of HIV acquisition by the receptive partner in unprotected oral sex with an HIV carrier is one per 10,000 acts. In vaginal sex, it's 10 per 10,000 acts. In anal sex, it's 50 per 10,000 acts. Do the math. Oral sex is 10 times safer than vaginal sex. Anal sex is five times more dangerous than vaginal sex and 50 times more dangerous than oral sex. 

Other useful academic data is also available on the PDF link within the article.  
I don't think there has ever been any discension here that anal sex is a riskier activity then vaginal sex which is riskier then oral sex. This is a well accepted fact, supported by organisations like the WHO etc. However, this does not mean anal sex is bad or should be banned. If you claim otherwise then you should also support banning all sexual activity. Or hey why not just ban all contact between people? Nor does it mean people having anal sex are at more risk then people having vaginal sex. Someone having protected anal sex is likely to be at far lower risk then someone having unprotected vaginal and probably even oral sex. In fact, I wonder if a polygamic gay man wh",[],0

The question is not whether the incident reflects badly on Kennedy, but whether it's important enough to include in this article.  We have to make judgments about that.  There's a discussion going on right now at the George W. Bush article about including a reference to the calls for impeaching Bush.  You could write a factually accurate sentence or paragraph about it, but most of us think it should be omitted anyway, because it's just not important.  No one has even suggested (as far as I remember) that the Bush article include a paragraph about his brother and the Silverado scandal.

...which is the reason why I first discuss it, then change it.  An edit war is nothing pretty, you  know?  We'll see.  Anyway, what you write is largely true, but misleading. Especially:

- Free oxygen, free fluorine and moisture surely will corrode the metallic walls.  However, the chemical potential of the salt has to be controlled anyway so it is slightly on the reducing side, containing some trivalent uranium.  So any free oxygen or fluorine will oxydize the uranium ions, not the metal structure.  Moisture will be driven out with the off-gas at working temperatures.  All this is pretty much a non-issue.

- Cryolithe.  Yes, aluminium is produced by electrolysing alumina with cryolithe.  This can be considered a mixture or solution of sodium flouride, aluminium fluoride and aluminum oxide, certainly a molten salt.  But the cryolithe is really only a fluxing agent, it is chemically non-agressive and it doesn't extract aluminium or something.  You hinted that it does, which  is really misleading.

- Heating is not a technological issue.  Sure, it adds to the cost, but other than that there's no problem.  A power reactor would run quite some time without ever being cooled down, refuelling is done by adding some molten or even solid salt, without shutdown, cooling or heating.  

- But tritium is a problem.  To slow down tritium formation, the lithium in the salt has to be almost pure Li-7, and even then tritium will form.  Tritium in the salt is no problem, it doesn't attack metals.  Tritium migrating from the salt is a problem.  ORNL says, they were able to chemically trap the tritium in the secondary cooling loop.  A problem, yes, but nothing major.

And of course there are the political issues.  An MSR doesn't fit into the """"razor-blade"""" business model currently employed, research is still needed, and that is expensive, waste reprocessing is currently illegal (though this is stupid when also applied to pyroprocessing), and uranium is too cheap these days to make a breeder economically viable.

Now this is the kind of approach to discussion I like. What we need to do is find a way to keep track of all these issues, discuss them (separately or in clusters  whatever works best in various cases), then figure out how to implement what we decide, etc. Now, I really have to get to work now (sometimes I go to work in the middle of the night  quieter, no distractions) but let me quickly suggest the following. Would you mind if, later, I reorder these to bring related issues together, maybe group them into headings, and number them? Then it can be a kind of master checklist while we open separate discussion threads on each issue or cluster, referring to them by number, etc. As new issues come up we can add them under the appropriate heading in the list, and come back to it later if need be. Also, if we get stuck on something (e.g. """"Need to get book X at library"""" or """"EEng and CG decided to take a break on this one before they kill each other"""") we can just note that in the list as the status for that issue, and switch to another issues for a while.

also, i think you should reinstate info on the actual size of the extension and where this took place. you might also want to say that the extension was built on the site of the old bus station and car park (info is there on the reference Kingsgate extension on schedule for August 2008 opening by Mivan). as we both probably want to get this article to GA, i would remove all references to the word locate within that section. this is one of many words or phrases that should be avoided if aiming for GA status. that's why when i originally wrote that paragraph on the Kingsgate and other retail areas, i specifically kept the use of the word in question to a minimum. if it isn't dealt with now, it will be at a later date.

Answer: Thank you. - The allegiance that I corrected it to was the 'British Empire', not the UK. The """"Allegiance"""" category in this section applies to Currie's military career, which his WW1 service was the centerpiece of. That conflict was a clash between the British Empire & the German Empire, not Canada vs Germany. Canada declared war on the German Empire in 1914 as a integral part of the British Empire which was threatened as a whole, not as an independent country in isolation. Currie in 1914 would have regarded himself as defending the British Empire, not Canada in isolation, which was under no individual threat from Germany in the least. 

I understand the enthusiasm for Canadian patriotism, but it doesn't really make historical sense to use allegiance to Canada in this context, & it's a mistake to take contemporary sentiments & backdate them onto the past like this, where sentiment was different in these matters.

It would make sense to put military allegiance to the British Empire with that symbol for Currie's martial career, & the Canuck Red Ensign  (great flag, which should be re-introduced today imo, by the way) next to his nationality or birthplace, but putting military allegiance to Canada in the context of WW1 doesn't make contemporary historical sense?

You continue with the angle that you are capabable of NPOV. No one is is capable of NPOV regarding a Political isssue here in the US at this time but least of all you. One has only to read your contributions to see that you clearly have no interest in neutrality. I have admited my POV from day one while everyone conservative has to have the rock they hide under lifted. (see Ai.Kefu)

The game at hand here now is how much truth can be added by the liberal P'sOV before it is sanitized and censored by the conservative side. There should be no pretense of neutrality here or on any other political site just a much more modest goal of contributors finding some semblance of """"balance"""" between the two distinct P'sOV in the overall article. There is no way the article can remain """"Fluffy"""" with no mention of her deeds and or disdain from the entire black community and the other communities of whom civil rights are trampled on. I just wish the large negative View about a Condi would stop being sanitized summarily. 

If you cannot admit that neutrality is impossible from you or any other conservative or liberal contributor then the conversation we are pretending to have can come to a quick cessation and we can just agree to disagree so we can resume with the rapid fire edit/revert/bashing/revert/censorship... activity that will lead to the ultimate freezing of the article """,[],0

I'll clear the air here before I continue upon the current situation. 

I feel like I am being painted as the bad guy here, and that my editing and/or the editing of others is considered to be an American POV. I quote 

 Yet it was apparently Americans who started this article.

For the record. Yes I started this article. No I am not American. Such accusations that I am American and therefore my stance at maintaining the American ratings is of a POV nature are not only unfounded but unfair.

Secondly in regards to the link and image. This is no place to discuss such an issue here to begin with, and bringing it up in this situation is simply adding fuel to the fire. Furthermore it is simply a slap in the face given that just hours prior to your post I had re-opened dialogue asking for help choosing 1 of 4 new images for the infobox located here: Talk:Rookie Blue#New_Image. Since you have brought this up I have no choice but to defend myself and the editors involved about violations of NPOV. The items in question were added in this edit:  at 23:08, 17 May 2010. At the time of the edit the only available material was from the ABC. I refer you to the following two links. The first will show that the ABC Rookie Blue website was indexed on the 28 Apr 2010. The second link will show that the GlobalTV Rookie Blue website was indexed on the 12 Jun 2010. Hell I will even used google.ca:

ABC:
http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&lr;=&tbs;=qdr%3Ay&q;=%22http%3A%2F%2Fabc.go.com%2Fshows%2Frookie-blue%22&aq;=f&aqi;=&aql;=&oq;=&gs;_rfai=

Global:
http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&lr;=&tbs;=qdr%3Ay&q;=%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.globaltv.com%2Frookieblue%2Findex.html%22&aq;=f&aqi;=&aql;=&oq;=&gs;_rfai=

As you can see Logical_Fuzz did no wrong as the material from Global was not available to him/her till nearly a month later. As far as I know Logical_Fuzz is in the North American region. Specifically what nationality I am unsure of, but his/her edits were made in good faith and not in an American POV. Any further allegations that state me or other editors that have contributed to this article or the main article have violated NPOV, without proper proof backing those allegations; will not be met with too kindly.

Third. I was the one who added that is was a Canadian police drama (evidence here: ) as I accept it is a mainly a Canadian production. If I wanted to I could easily say it was a Canadian-American production. This should further dispel any such allegations that I am in violation of NPOV.

Now on with what I am to say. As I said I accept that this is mainly a Canadian Production. The page says Canadian but it also says the following:

 The series is a joint venture between Canwest Broadcasting and ABC, and produced by E1 Entertainment.

Given that Canwest also put out a joint announcement with the ABC () renewing Rookie Blue for a second season, I think it is fair to say a joint venture doesn't mean that anything American immediately takes a back seat. In regards to the """"Do not add foreign broadcasters here"""" comment. I am confused. Are you suggesting we remove the ABC as the original channel? Or have you just read it wrong and trying to argue that the picture and website don't below because it says """"Do not add foreign broadcasters here""""?

Read the first sentence of this whole exchange.

"""

 It is all just terminology 

Perhaps all this argument is about nothing but terminology.  Does anyone disagree with any of the following statements?  It is assumed throughout that the car is placed randomly, the players initial pick is random, and that the host always opens an unchosen door to reveal a goat.

1) The probability of winning by switching, given that the player has picked door 1 and the host has opened door 3, is between 1/2 and 1 depending on the hosts door preference. (This is clearly a conditional probability)

2) The probability of winning by switching, given that the player has picked door 1 and the host has opened door 2, is between 1/2 and 1 depending on the hosts door preference. (This is clearly a conditional probability)

3) The probability of winning by switching, given that the player has picked door 1 and the host has opened one of the unchosen doors, is 2/3 for all host preferences. (Morgan call this the unconditional case, maybe this is where the confusion arises).

4) The probability of winning by switching given that the player has picked a door and the host has opened one of the unchosen doors is 2/3 for all host preferences.

5) The probability of winning by switching on average for player who switch is 2/3 for all host preferences.

  
You're right. And notice that in case 3, opening one of the unchosen doors is not a condition, because it is part of the rules of the game. The only condition, if you would consider the full model, there is the initial picking of door 1. In case 4 there is no condition at all in the full model and hence it is the same as case 5. But ... notice that in the MHP a specific door has been chosen and a door opened.  

I continue here. The difficulty is what we do mean by probability. If you mean an average over all cases in which any door has been opened, there is, as I mentioned, no condition. If you mean: a door has been opened, but I do not know which one, and I want to average over all cases concerning the same door, the answer depends on the door and is a number between 1/2 and 1.   

I do not quite agree with you.  If we average over all cases where a door has been opened, but you do not know which one, the answer is 2/3 if we include all possible host strategies in our average.  The only way to get an answer other than 2/3 is to average over cases where the host has a fixed strategy and the same door is opened every time.   

Nijdam, do you see the connection with my simple problem in which a prize is placed behind one of two doors and the player then picks a door?  If the player picks randomly the probability of winning is 1/2.  If the player has picked just one specific door then the probability of winning depends on the initial prize placement.   
  
Who else agrees?   

I agree with #1 and #2.  I find #3, #4 and #5 somewhat ambiguous without further clarification, for example I don't know precisely what you mean by """"for all host preferences"""".  I would agree with the following revised versions:

By 'for all host preferences' I mean regardless of whether the host policiy is to: always open door 2 where possible, always open door 3 where possible, choose randomly where there is a choice, or employ any other method of deciding which door to open within the stated rules.   
  
3) The probability of winning by switching, given that the player has picked door 1, is 2/3.

4) The probability of winning by switching, given that the player has picked a door, is 2/3.

5) The probability of winning by switching on average for players who switch is 2/3.

This person's IP seems to change frequently (I've seen edits from 69.225.5.4, 69.225.5.183, 69.226.111.130, 69.226.106.109, and 69.226.103.13 apparently from this same user on WT:BRFA in the past 5 or so months), and I guess he eventually created this """"IP69.226.103.13"""" account to answer concerns over that; at times he still neglects to log in. I have no indication as to whether he has other accounts or just extensive experience as an IP user. I know of at least one short civility block for this user, although I don't recall the specific IP. In general, I've found the user helpful when not overreacting to various issues, which unfortunately does occur rather often. I'm not sure whether an indef would be a net positive for the project or not. You'd have to identify and examine his contributions under his various IP addresses to get a full picture. Anomie⚔

The fundamental unit of program is the basic block; a basic block is a stretch of program which has a single entry point and a single exit point. The purpose of section 4 is to prepare for section 5 a table of predecessors (PRED table) which enumerates the basic blocks and lists for every basic block each of the basic blocks which can be its immediate predecessor in flow, together with the absolute frequency of each such basic block link. This table is obtained by an actual """"execution"""" of the program in Monte-Carlo fashion, in which the outcome of conditional transfers arising out of IF-type statements and computed GO TO'S is determined by a random number generator suitably weighted according to whatever FREQUENCY statements have been provided.

And I had hoped that, because measurement is done both with clocks we build (to measure time in material reality) and with our conscious experience (which is debated among philosophers and lay people as to whether or not that is contained in material reality or is somehow different) that you guys (with the exceptions of SQ and JW) would see the wisdom of not jamming them together in a run-on sentence and see the wisdom of setting up the topic in all three major POVs: Time as phenomenon, Time as physical measurement, Time as experience right away in two lede sentences.  Everything else in the article will fall under one of those three; """"religion, philosophy, and science... business, industry, sports, the sciences, music, dance, and the live theater"""".  I am convinced that the professor would grade my lede definition higher than what is there now, and far better than what was there before.  Too bad.

Perhaps. Generally, if something is commonly known as exactly """"Dallas"""", that should be listed on the disambiguation page.

 Borges' Apocryphal Quote

That in general, then, should be found upon the surface of England, map constructions which more or less roughly represent the whole of England, — all this has nothing puzzling about it. Any ordinary map of England spread out upon English ground would illustrate, in a way, such
possession, by a part of the surface of England, of a resemblance to the whole. But now suppose that this our resemblance is to be made absolutely exact, in the sense previously defined.""""  Royce goes on for awhile.

It was not a personal attack, but rather a racist remark about Indians in general.

Anir1uph showed failure to use the English language correctly, common practice among non-native English speakers. I am fed up with uneducated third world citizens who edit Wikipedia according to their own POV. Anir1uph is a pretentious editor and forms fart of a larger Indian demographic who subtly edit Wikipedia pushing their own POV, using weasel words and do not adhere to consensus. There is a growing concern among a considerable number of White Western editors that due to the increased availability of computers and the internet around the world - the number of uneducated third world citizens with a POV agenda to their edits is rising rapidly. Nationalism is a large factor in this and it isn't healthy for the Wikipedia community. There is an ongoing clash of culture and outlooks, Asians view the world differently than Europeans and North Americans. In my opinion the sooner editors are restricted to editing Wikipedia in their native tongue the better.

I would just like to note that I do not see why my last comment was deleted, Charles. (Nor indeed why the comment by Jess was deleted). 

This entry was being vandalised by somebody who describes Hari as a """"little tyke"""" and was abusing other commenters by accusing them of being impostors. Given the opportunity to prove these people were not impostors, he refused. I was only pointing this out, so it can be borne in mind in future if this person continues to try to vandalise this entry.

How can responding to personal abuse with calm, reasoned arguments like this be described as itself personal abuse?

I totally understand why you are keen to shut down the nasty sniping that was becoming common here, but I don't think that's achieved by silencing people who are trying to point out personality-motivated vandalism so it too can be stopped.

Please don't just delete this message; it's really important to put down a polite, civilised marker about this. I think there is a strong case, once somebody has started abusing the subject of an entry in odd ways and abusing literally everybody else who edits it, to ban them from contributing further. To instead ban anybody who raises this question seems perverse. I think we should discuss it in a calm way, that doesn't accuse anybody of being a mysterious impostor or make any personal attacks.

"incorrect interpretation! 

The european translator, assumed that since hafez was a follower of sufism and love in sufism had sometimes been pederastic, therefore the beloved should have been a young boy. Well, I am looking at the persian version of the verses translated by  Henry Wilberforce-Clarke, and as person whose mother tongue is persian it seems to me that the beloved was an adult female rather than a young boy. Since hafez is using pronouns to refer to his beloved and the cupbeareand, one could go both ways but in persian we always use the phrase 'lock of hair of the beloved' to refer to females (since they have long hair you know). Besides anyone who is familiar with hafez poetry and have an advance understanding of medieval persian language, would know that Hafez is very unlikely to have pederastic inclinations.
I am well aware of the existance pederasty in many teachings of sufism and I have seen the pederastic sentiments in Jami and Saadi poems but Not all persian poets that follow sufism have pederastic inclinations!!.",[],0

"Hi Osmond, Please understand, I really like your images. I'd love to have all of them added to articles. I think the collection itself is notable and may merit an WP article itself. But WP is a sometimes difficult place to get started contributing because they have so many different guidelines and different editors interpret them different ways. WP requires that when images are contributed the contributor has to be able to demonstrate that they fit the open source or Creative Commons licensing policy. 

 Because you are the uploader of the images, your simple declaration of their provenance, that the images are all pre-1923 and are of the people you say they are, may not be sufficient to meet WP guidelines. I truly believe that many of them in fact are of the individuals stated. The likenesses are very clear, though in a few instances, less so. I'd really like to help you get the images accepted as valid. They are a wonderful contribution to the historic lore about the individuals who they are supposed to be pictures of.

 I'm sorry, I'm not near Kearny, Missouri this week, or I'd love to see the collection. Is that where you're from?

 I'm not the final arbiter of all of this. I suggest we get some input from other editors on how to validate that the images are genuine and their provenance is proven. To start, this will probably require you to provide some third-party sources to establish that the images were taken before 1923, or proof that the studio on the image closed before 1923, or other evidence. Then you will have to provide some third-party opinion that the images are of the individuals taken. Or you'll have to make available other evidence that the person's names were written on the images. The articles you named may be helpful if you can provide source info, links, or publication info. 

 I'm totally on your side. I'd like to find a way to establish the authenticity of the images. But you also have to understand that as the owner of the images, if you can clearly establish the authenticity of the images, you could be greatly rewarded financially. So you're not a disinterested person when it comes to proving the that pictures are of the people you say they are. Because this is a complex issue, due diligence is required.

 Give me a day or two to explore the proper way to get other editors input into this discussion. There's a formal process for this kind of thing and I'm not sure what it is. —  (talk to me) (what I've done)",[],0

The Keighley store was destroyed by arson as well, in about 1998. Of course, before it burnt down baked beans were 7p. After it burnt down, they went up to 10p because they were cooked.

It is true that the Keighley store burned down, it moved out to Crossflatts while it was being rebuilt. The bean prices, though, were just a joke that were being passed around at the time.  

 Request for info review 

I've just had a look at this selection and I don't think it should belong in this article.  This is the section

The cause has not yet been identified but it is believed to have been started by a faulty heater. The fire broke out at around 4am and firefighters from around the area were called to battle the flames. The fire was not completely put out until about 12pm. It is not yet known whether the building will be demolished and rebuilt. Netto is famously associated with good value but there is a definite negative connotation linked to the supermarket chain associated with cheapness, being mainly a food shop for the lower working class. It is becoming very popular with schoolchildren who often claim that a fellow classmate shops there, as to insult the receiver (due to Netto being known for its cheapness). 

My view is that it is unescessary information and the negative connotation section is an indirect attack at Netto.  I personally have never got that impression myself or heard those connotations and they do not need to be in this article surely?   The schoolchild quote is again not needed in the article.

Echoing the statement above, with some more elucidation: there is no objective criteria under which the Telegraph is a more objective (or """"reputable"""") source than Counterpunch.

It is not hard to see that a right-wing ideologue Weiner did a hit-piece on Edward Said using funds from a right-wing think tank, published it in a right wing journal (Commentary), that was picked up by a sympathetic newspaper (the Daily Telegraph).

"Michael Kimmel is also frequently cited, but he's not just a sociologist interested in masculinities, he's a decidedly pro-feminist sociologist that is also hostile to Father's Rights groups.  He is the president of NOMAS and, to quote an article on the front page of his site today:

Want To Be A Good Dad? Support Mom And Avoid Father’s Rights Groups

Over the past decade, fatherhood has been all the rage and dads are naturally the talk of pundits on Father’s Day. So let’s say you’re a divorcing dad and you’re having trouble coping. You look for help on the internet and discover the father’s rights movement.

Be warned – avoid father’s rights groups like the plague. According to the pro-feminist men’s group The National Organization For Men Against Sexism (NOMAS), “male supremacist groups (“Father’s Rights”) have caused unspeakable harm to our country and to our children by encouraging abusive fathers, often with little past involvement with their children, to seek custody as a tactic to pressure a mother to return or to punish her for leaving. “Shared parenting”, “friendly parent”, involvement of both parents and other concepts that seem fair and benevolent have instead been used to manipulate courts and legislatures to help abusive fathers.

Again, these are feminist groups that, frankly, view men as biologically and culturally flawed to begin with and father's as unnecessary opining as to the beliefs and goals of people interested in father's rights and, here on Wikipedia, they are characterized as, not just authoritative sources for information on father's rights groups, but also members of those groups who act as their spokesman.  It should go without saying but quotes like the above and sources that make them would be universally reviled by anyone interested in father's rights advocacy.  When authors like this are cited it should be clarified that they are hostile to father's and father's rights and have views that are diametrically opposed to any that the mainstream FRM would actually espouse",[],0

Suggestions on how to do so can be found  here.

Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. Using one of the templates at Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline is an easy way to ensure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template.

 Re: Thanks for restoring links 
Hi; you're quite welcome. I didn't think you removed the interlanguage links intentionally. The spam/vandalism was indeed added by 221.197.20.66—the same spammer/vandal returned today via 221.198.74.212. Since this is an obvious (and shameless) attempt to use Wikipedia to increase the page ranking of the spammer's website (see Wikipedia:Spam), I've put in a request at m:Non-development tasks for developers#Spam regex requests to have the domain shop263.com added to the project-wide spam filter.

 Zone system 

I would appreciate your leaving the mention in. First Ansel Adams, in his three volume 1980 basic photography series, presented the Zone system this way and he explicitly said, in so many words, that his aim is not to force his own system of photography on anyone, but to encourage photographers to better understand their equipment in order to control the finished photograph. He disapproved of winging it, not of any particular system. The Zone system worked for him. And the Zone system is controversial, believe it or not. I know of at least one vocational school photography teacher (years ago when I lived in Montreal) who told students not to bother with it, and it seems he was not alone. 

Also, please wait a few days before doing a major edit job. I liked the article as it used to be and I was sorely tempted to revert most of your changes, but did not. I particularly liked the wording """"dynamic range"""" and miss it, and I'm sorry to say I now personally find the article less approachable to a newcomer. 

Dynamic range is very appropriate: for instance (I'm making numbers up here for the sake of argument) if we say reality has a Zone 0 to X range of 1 to 100,000 , then a finished print has a range of 1 to 10,000 , while a typical digital camera will only provide a range of 1 to 1,000 . A move from 100,000 to 10,000 to 1,000 seems pretty dynamic to me...

However, since I'm not going to reread the whole Basic Photography series or even go into a darkroom again (space is at a premium in Tokyo) I'm not willing to put too much effort into maintaining this page.  05:52, 30 Sep 2004 (UTC)

Hi Vincent:
Which idea, specifically, did you wish to restore to the zone system article? That the zone system is/was not advocated by all? (I'd say that's probably true for most any school of thought.) That Ansel Adams was not dogmatic about this being the only way to do things? (I'd say that unless there is a large public misimpression that he was dogmatic it's not worth mentioning, no more than it's necessary to mention that every painter or sculptor or engineer held other approaches to various disciplines were equally valid.)

Here's the problem with """"dynamic range,"""" Vincent: it's inaccurate jargon. (It's oft-used and familiar jargon, but sloppy and inaccurate nonetheless.) First, it's redundant. The meaning most attribute to """"dy",[],0

 When will Man be ready to accept that our Time is not the Time of the Universe? 

http://www.fitinizini.com/theories_01.html

Theory of Multi-Dimensional Scalable Worlds
By Dr. Fortunato Da COSTA in Theory of Multi-Dimensional Scalable Worlds * 

""""When will Man be ready to accept that our Time is not the Time of the Universe?"""" 

Principle I – Empiric – Entity and World Scale relationship: 
In the Universe each Entity (constellation, star, planet, animal, vegetable, micro organism, molecule, …) belongs to its own WORLD SCALE defined by two major dimensions the LIFE SCALE (Average Life Time Scale) and the SPACE SCALE (Average Size Scale) of the Entity. 

Principle II – Empiric – The fulfillment principle: 
Each particular Entity, in its Space Scale, has everything needed to complete its life cycle and in its respective Life Scale there is enough time to, also, complete its life cycle with success. 

Principle III – Empiric – World Scales existence: 
According to our human kind World Scale there is an undetermined number of Smaller World Scales below us – microorganisms, molecules, atoms, … – and another undetermined number of Larger World Scales above us – planets, stars, constellations, .... 

Principle IV – Empiric – Time and Space Relationship: 
The Life Scale is directly proportional to the Space Scale. As smaller the Space Scale of an Entity as small it is the respective Life Scale of that Entity. 
Nature clearly shows that there is a relationship between Life Scales and Space Scales – the empiric observation demonstrates that the absolute life time of a planet is much longer than of a human. And the absolute life time of a human is much longer than of a butterfly – so, there is an evident empiric relationship between Time and Space that we humans never saw and took into scientific consideration. 
Example of an empiric formula that can be applied: 

Life_Scale = K x Space_Scale 
( K ~ 30 years/meters for mammals ) 

Principle V – Empiric – Imaginary Multidimensional Worlds existence: 
In Euclid’s geometry, if we consider ourselves a point in a plan, we only can observe just a line: this means that if we are a point in a two dimensions world, we only can percept one dimension. 
The same rule can be extrapolated to understand that if we are an Entity in a four dimensions World Scale (X, Y, Z, and Time) there is, at least, another extra dimension that we cannot see or understand its existence because it is not possible to percept it from the World Scale where we are in. Only using the imaginary complex number i=(-1) ½ it is possible to mathematically define that imaginary dimension from the World Scale where we do belong. 
This takes us to the conclusion that multidimensional Worlds DO exist and we are part of Multidimensional Worlds with, at least, an extra dimension that we cannot observe or understand, because they are imaginary to us: i=(-1) ½. 

Principle VI – Empiric – Relative Intelligence and Relative Perspective: 
Can we ask to a blind born human the reason why the sea is blue? If the Entity does not percept the atmosphere color dimension, because it was never a Real Dimension in its World Scale, it is not possible for him to justify that phenomenon. The Entity only can make that justification if he is capable of creating a mathematical model where the sky color dimension is introduced as an imaginary dimension i=(-1) ½. 
So, we have to introduce two new concepts: the Relative Perspective and the Relative Intelligence. 
RELATIVE PERSPECTIVE is the set of Real Dimensions that the Entity cans percept from its World Scale. 
RELATIVE INTELLIGENCE is the capability of the Entity to understand, to predict and to make use of phenomena happening inside its World Scale’s Relative Perspective. By this principle all entities are rational and intelligent in their respective Relative Perspective Referentials. 
So, the Human Kind or any other Entity, only can justify the scientific phenomena that are totally functions of Dimensions that are Real (and not Imaginary) in the World Scale of that Entity. Unless the Entity is intelligent enough to extrapolate its relative perspective using imaginary dimensions, i=(-1) ½, in their mathematical models. 

Principle VII – Empiric – The Extra Imaginary Dimension existence principle: 
Why our Planet Earth has to change its rotation routines? Why there are Gravitational Forces that should approach the macrocosms but, instead, the cosmos is splitting itself? How can we justify scientific phenomena that we cannot understand? Obviously there is, at least, an extra imaginary dimension that we cannot percept or understand from our World Scale (X, Y, Z, and Time) that relates the different MULTI-DIMENSIONAL WORLD SCALES above and",[],0

"Well, I am not goint to stay, it simply to much of a waste of time, maybe I will check back in in a few years, and I would be happy to provide reading recommendations for anyone who asks me. (It would not be hard to find my real e-mail address using the information about me you already know). But I will take up this last discussion because of your specific invitation. 

The Tangut did not speak Chinese, they spoke their own language. The official name of their land in their own language has been written about by Ksenia Kepping and is available on a link from the Tangut Language page. In no case was Xia there autonym. It was something like Minyag which is waht they are called in Tibetan. 

In general I have a big chip on my sholder about Sinologists becomming confucian literati. The Yuan, and Qing were no more Chinese than I am. To use Chinese names for these political entities is to take for granted the medieval Chinese worldview. While now it is indeed true that the PRC owns a big chunk of Asia how much of it is actually historically China?

The Jurchen's, Kitans, Tangut, Mongols, Tibetans, Nanchao, Azha (Tüyühün) were their own countries with their own languages and customs. Tangut history is relevant to Chinese history in the way that French history is relevant to English history, but also vice versa. 

To have a thing on the article saying 'this article is part of the section Chinese History' reinforces the view that the Tangut's don't deserve their own history. 

There is a sociological fact about Western academia that Sinology is big and well funded, while Tangutology, Nanchaology, Kitanology etc. are all virtually nonexistant. But this is a fact about us, and not about the history of Central/East Asia.",[],0

My assumption is that an object such as the Yamiking needs a lot of energy to rise up to the main world compared to the limited amount of energy that individuals can use.  Thus, the Table of Sacrifices is needed to gather energy from twelve individuals (in the form of a clock) to power the Yamiking.

"Putins annihilation of certain cities has nothing to do with this topic. If you're going to make an argument make it relative. Political influence of Russia and its military influence are different things. The article makes no claim that Germany is a European regional power. Turkey also has influences on areas not considered part of the historical middle east such as Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan, Georgia, etc. Again exclusively adding a Geographical location to the Term Regional Power for Turkey is nothing but Euro-centric racism. Turkey is regionally considered middle Eastern by most countries regardless of including the statement. The statement was put there so others wont think that a country like Turkey could possibly have influence on a continent like Europe. By adding that, one is implying that Turkey isn't good enough to influence Europe even though no one is claiming it does. It is also making sure no one assumes Turkey is anything but Middle Eastern.

Reckless, the policy and guideline were both updated last year to move away from the era of small screens and slow downloads; this was around the time en.WP sucessfully pushed the Foundation techs to move the whole 300 projects, gradually, from 180px to 220px default thumbnail size: great!). In fact, for readers with slow connections it's often better to have a larger display in an article, so they are less likely to need to double-click on the original; originals are often huge and take much longer to download. I am generalising here, and individual cases need to be judged on their merits. BTW, I encourage all editors to arrange and size images WRT narrow-to-wide window widths and font sizes/skins, etc. Just move your window through from narrow to wide to see what a difference it makes in the way text and pics interact. For this reason, left-side placements need to be treated with caution when there are right-side pics in the same section.

"Article should be moved to Mark Basseley Youssef, with redirect 

Today the U.S. Attorney requested that the name of the criminal case be changed from U.S.A. v. Nakoula Basseley Nakoula to U.S.A. v. Mark Basseley Youssef, because the latter is his true legal name.  Here's an excerpt from the request (docket No. 63):

As alleged by the United States Probation Office, on or about October 1, 2002, defendant filed a motion in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Orange, case number A215011, in which he requested that his true legal name be changed from Nakoula Basseley Nakoula to Mark Basseley Youssef, and an order changing defendant's name to Mark Basseley Youssef was issued as a result of this motion.  Notwithstanding this fact, defendant represented to this Court in connection with his underlying criminal case that his true legal name was Nakoula Basseley Nakoula; to date, he has used the Nakoula identity on all documentation provided to this Court and to the Probation during the entirety of his term on supervised release; and he simultaneously possessed identification in this name, as well as the Youssef identity, while on supervised release, in violation of his conditions of supervised release.
... Chief Magistrate Judge Suzanne H. Segal ordered the government to file this request ... Accordingly, the government respectfully requests that future pleadings in this case be captioned to refer to defendant by his true legal name, Mark Basseley Youssef ...

I expect that in the next couple weeks, the major news media will follow the court's lead and switch to primarily referring to him as Youssef (while still frequently mentioning the Bacile and Nakoula aliases).

 How to Get the Wiki-Astrology Page Back Online & Honest 

One of the best ways to get the Astrology Page back to good use was mentioned by Chris Brennan, who wisely thought that a Wiki-project on Astrology would help. I agree with Chris. Astrology is most likely the oldest, and best documented science in the history of humankind, leading to the invention of mathematics, medicine, and many other disciplines taken for granted by conventional science. Moreover, the history of astrology is also well-documented, even in the United States, where it must be remembered that it is an historical fact that the Founding Fathers of the U.S. not only practiced astrology, but used its principles to set, and then build Washington D.C., aligning the capital with the fixed stars in the constellation Virgo. The expert astrologers, and those with the knowledge base have worked hard, and seriously to improve the page; however, the arguments that seek to """"debase"""" astrology from a POV has disrupted the Wiki-Astrology page based on the failure to not accept historical facts while promoting a """"pseudo-science"""" viewpoint designed to blot out over 5,000 years of historical and scientific fact. A balance, with facts, surely can proceed, and Chris Brennan's idea of a project would help to combine diversifed views into cohesive subject matter that seeks to enlighten the mind, rather than to darken it. Welcoming views that seek to expand the knowledge base, rather than to shrink it through personal POV, is the best course. """,[],0

 A week at the Tito article 

Hi Guys,

I know that what I said to you in my outburst, the one that earned me a weekend in the cooler, was wrong. Of course it was. I apologise to you for that. A week later, however, I think you can see what we are up against here in the 'Balkan' domain. AndreaFox entered a post at ANI which superficially looked genuine. You all supported him/her. With hindsight, it can be seen that the edit(s) entered that DIREKTOR and I opposed/rejected/reverted were appallingly POV and supported by a desperate scratching around for internet sources that, when found, ranged from the neo-fascist (Sunić/IHR) to the vaguely circumstantial (Meares the translator). I, personally, have no doubt that Tito was no angel - he was a flawed human being, just as we all are - but I will not stand idly by while POV monsters attempt to abuse our Wikipedia to """"fight the good fight"""". That's why I was (unacceptably) angry a week ago, but I hope that the developments of the last week enable you all to see what we face here. I, speaking only for myself, think that the Tito article in question dwells way too much on the WWII period, with not enough on the major period that should be covered, namely his time as head of state.

 The Band's legacy, Beggar's Banquet, etc. 

An anonymous user is repeatedly misreading The Guardian source and insisting on adding a dubious tag to it.  Here's the direct quote:

The spark for Fairport taking this watershed turn was the Band's 1968 album Music from Big Pink, the record that - along with Bob Dylan and the Band's Basement Tapes bootleg - brought about a widespread musical volte-face, in which what remained of psychedelia was replaced by a new rootsiness. Among the rock aristocracy, its influence was evident in the Beatles' ill-fated back-to-basics project Let It Be, the Rolling Stones' purple patch that began with Beggars Banquet, and Eric Clapton's decision to call time on Cream.

The anonymous user takes issue with this statement, claiming that Music from Big Pink could not have influenced Beggar's Banquet because of chronology, i.e., that the Stones were almost done recording the album when Big Pink came out.  But, read the statement: it does not say that it influenced the recording of Banquet, but the """"purple patch that began with...,"""" etc.  This seems clear to me.

"""Hi. You should be aware of the following official Wikipedia policies - this is an excerpt from WP:EL:

 Links normally to be avoided 
 
Except for a link to a page that is the subject of the article or an official page of the article subject—and not prohibited by restrictions on linking—one should avoid:
 Any site that does not provide a unique resource beyond what the article would contain if it became a Featured article.
 Any site that misleads the reader by use of factually inaccurate material or unverifiable research. See Reliable sources for explanations of the terms """"factually inaccurate material"""" or """"unverifiable research"""".
 Any site that attempts to surreptitiously install malware on a visitor's computer.
 Links mainly intended to promote a website.
 Links to sites that primarily exist to sell products or services. For example, instead of linking to a commercial bookstore site, use the """"ISBN"""" linking format, giving readers an opportunity to search a wide variety of free and non-free book sources.

You recently added a link to Western honey bee that violated the last two of these restrictions; I know the temptation to use WP to promote your site is strong, and you can claim that your site includes useful information, but it STILL self-promotion, and you SELL things on that website. You can't link that on Wikipedia. Note the following additional excerpt from the same policy page:

 Advertising and conflicts of interest 

Due to the rising profile of Wikipedia and the amount of extra traffic it can bring a site, there is a great temptation to use Wikipedia to advertise or promote sites. This includes both commercial and non-commercial sites. You should avoid linking to a website that you own, maintain or represent, even if the guidelines otherwise imply that it should be linked. If the link is to a relevant and informative site that should otherwise be included, please consider mentioning it on the talk page and let neutral and independent Wikipedia editors decide whether to add it. This is in line with the conflict of interest guidelines. Note that since Wikipedia uses nofollow tags, external links may not alter search engine rankings.

This is not personal, it's simply a matter of an official WP policy, and everyone has to play by the same rules.   """,[],0

Obviously there is presently none for seasons that haven't been released on Blu-ray but this is something that exists now in many tables for DVD entries. As Blu-ray versions are released, this information will be supplied. A separate Blu-ray table would unnecessarily duplicate content ad somebody would no doubt complain about that.

With respect, to say """"Specifically, it's not very objective"""" is not to be at all specific.  I can't tell if you think the page is biased in favor of its subject, or against him!  So, how about really being specific?    

Yeah, unless some specific discussion is taking place, the tag should be removed. And, btw, """"obviously, more information...will come out as the campaign develops"""" is not an argument supporting the claim of non-neutrality. Wikipedia is not a crystal ball. We objectively compile the sources that are available now. If more information does come out (in reliable sources), then (and only then) could it be included here.

 2) The State Department of the U.S. issued a directive to write Kyiv
 3) The Prime Minister of the U.K. calls the city Kyiv - http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page20199
 4) United Nations Multilingual Terminology Database (the ultimate body on geographical names) approved it as Kyiv - http://unterm.un.org/dgaacs/unterm.nsf/WebView/B57BF6AB5F06749B85256DC700440AAD?OpenDocument
 5) Major English speaking governments worldwide switched to Kyiv spelling
 6) CIA refers to the city as Kyiv - https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/up.html
 7) The name of the famous football club is Dynamo Kyiv (recognised worldwide)
 8) Many papers, e.g., British The Guardian, are already writing Kyiv
 9) All major Canadian media already use the spelling of Kyiv
 10) and many more reasons and references on http://kyiv.of-cour.se/

When editors say that the company is controversial and add multiple lawsuits filed against the company as direct support of the controversy the editors are providing their original research and opinion about the company. Wikipedia has a policy of No original research, and all of these lawsuits must be removed and the underlying statements that are supported solely by the lawsuits must be removed.

If another article discusses the lawsuit, a reliable secondary or tertiary source, for example, then the lawsuits can be included to support statements derived from the secondary or tertiary source. An example of this would be a full quote from the court case that is referenced in the reliable source.

I will, of course, listen to community input on this. However, I plan to remove all of the lawsuits that do not meet the requirements for proper referencing of a wikipedia article.",[],0

Oops, my bad.  Here's the explanation.  When I do a restoration I always upload an unrestored version for documentation purposes.  Normally I upload that to Commons, although with this particular image I accidentally uploaded the unrestored version locally.  So as soon as I realized the mistake I uploaded over at Commons and put a deletion request on the local version.  There's seldom any need for the unrestored version of a featured picture to have a hosting locally.  The restored version got featured, though.  So there's a reason to host it locally: the featured star is useful if anyone considers replacing it at an article (and occasionally editors do accidentally remove featured pictures from their primary articles).

"What would help a layman... 

A little background.
I have always loved languages. I am a native speaker of Arabic and English.
I have been dying to learn Hindi. Thanks to Wikipedia, I learned that Urdu would be a better place for me to start since I can already read the script.

However, I landed on the Retroflex consonant page when I could not read a few of the Urdu punctuation marks.

For me, the most glaring omission on the Retroflex consonant page is a small audio file so I can hear each sound. Telling me what it sounds like in a language I do not know (like Swedish or Polish) does not help. I was able to copy some words to Google Translate and listen to them there but that was of limited use.

I see that other articles have sound, video and animation so I do not think this would be a technical problem.

 Let me add a comment here in this discussion.  While it certainly seems strange that jokes are included on a page concerning 'religion', dismissing it completely without some discussion and consideration would be doing a disservice.  It may very well be that Bektashi culture is intimately tied to a rich collection of jokes which serve some pedagogical role in the religion.  For example, if we look at this site:
 http://www.alevibektasi.org/xalevis1.htm
 It is written that 
""""X. Alevi-Bektashi Humor
Alevis and Bektashis love to use humor to mock religious legalism, hypocrisy, and those who they feel have persecuted them. This humor reveals much about Alevi-Bektashi thought. To understand their humor is to understand the Alevi-Bektashis’ approach to life, religion, and their place in society. Here are only a few examples of the hundreds of Bektashi jokes (fıkralar) that have been collected.
This first joke reflects the Alevi attitude toward the legalism of the five pillars""""

 The author is John Shindeldecker, and he is listed as one of the researchers on the fairly official-looking homepage 
 http://www.alevibektasi.org/makale_engl.htm
 In this case, this material suggests that humor is an integral part of defining Bektashi culture as distinctive from other factions of Islam.  Much as Zen Buddhism is characterized by the sometimes meaningless Koans or Gospel music in certain factions of Protestant Christianity.  In all of these cases, I don't think it's fair to say that it's like """"adding black jokes to an article about African Americans.""""  This comparison is also a bit overreaching, and unwarranted.  AldirmaGonul has made a good faith case for why the jokes should be placed on this page.  freestylefrappe has deleted it by only saying that it's """"suspect"""" and """"racist"""".  But given what we read from another source, this seems an overly simplified and inaccurate depiction of the """"jokes"""" section.

"Ancient Warfare 

Hey Dirk. You gave a good answer to my question concerning the Roman tactics of bringing provinces into the Empire, and I read your similar question, and I may have an answer for you. There are a couple of major reasons as to twhy Alexander was able to take his army so far in so short a time. Alexander had the advantage of inheriting a great army from his father, and the Macedonian Empire saturated with, I believe, silver.

Another major factor was the Persians  they had a large army of hundreds of thousands, mostly conscripted agaist their will and treated very poorly. When Darius was defeated, he actually was treated like a liberator, and could have easily not only absorbed the remnants of the Persian army, but gained more volunteers.

The restored wording seems over-simplified.  It ignores the Council's attribution to the college of the bishops of the same powers that it attributes also to the Pope alone.  The Pope has within the college or body of the bishops a position analogous to that which Peter had within the college or body of the apostles.  It was to the college or body of the apostles, with Peter as its head, that Christ gave authority over the Church.  It is the college or body of the bishops, with the Pope as its head, that has succeeded to that authority.  Schreck does not deny this.  The Pope's position needs to be mentioned, but the position of the bishops as a body must also be mentioned.    
Thank you for your comments. Do you have a reference for your position above? I just want the article to be factually correct so I am using the information provided in the Nihil obstat Imprimatur declared source by Prof. Alan Schreck which states on page 159 (author cites Lumen Gentium 22 and Catechism para 882 for the following): """"For the Roman Pontiff, by reason of his office as Vicar of Christ, and as pastor of the entire Church has full, supreme, and universal power over the whole Church, a power which he can always exercise unhindered."""" That seems pretty clear to me and supports the article text in the lead describing him as the leader of the church.

ah, I'm not a woman from Yorkshire. Me mam is, so I have to watch a lot of her stuff. That was the point. Try keep up. As I am not at all a fan I cannot quote endless lines off the top of my bonce, but dinnerladies, for example, I found to be blisteringly unfunny. One example I was forced to view the other night saw one actor do a really long boring monolouge about christmas, the only laugh of which came from the word """"Miss Farnesbarnes"""" - which wasn't even pronounced humorously (like Rowan Atkinson could with """"Bob"""") - and that reminded me of something I saw where Julie Walters got all luvvied up in an interview about how Victoria uses masterful word play. I was left thinking if this is an example of """"masterful wordplay"""" Walters could benefit from watching Blackadder, Chic Murray or anything Eric Idle or Ronnie Barker ever touched. It's a vaugely silly word deliviered by a wooden actor (it was one of those ones she always surounds herself with so they don't steal her limelight)

Then there's one that always sticks in my head for sheer crapness about marks and spencers who's """"trousers are dropping off"""" (i.e. declining in quality/falling down). Now where is the humour in that? It's just a pointless, witless, bottom of the barrel seaside postcard humor that would make Julian Clary cringe. I know bum/trouser jokes are an aquired taste but The Young Ones, French and Saunders, Monty Python, Morecambe and Wise, Tommy Cooper, Les Dawson - they've all managed to construct a well thought through and vaugely witty bum-joke. Simply suggesting that trousers can concieveably fall down by way of an unrelated pun is neither sharp nor funny.

Add a couple of sentences, either in the lead or in the historiography section, explaining why this division is somewhat problematic. (Mind, any division that gets established is problematic, for the same reasons)
Have a solid background-section to draw the lines from before 800 into our period. I've slready started that, but it might be expanded.

[edit] BiographyCuban was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania[6][7] and grew up in the Pittsburgh suburb of Mt. Lebanon, in a Jewish[8] working-class family. His last name was shortened from """"Chabenisky"""" when his Russian grandparents landed on Ellis Island.[9] Cuban's father Norton was an automobile upholsterer.[6][10][11] Cuban's first step into the business world occurred at age 12, when he sold garbage bags to pay for a pair of expensive basketball shoes.[6][12] While in school, he held a variety of jobs, including bartender, disco dancing instructor, and party promoter. He paid for college by collecting and selling stamps, and once gained about $1,100 from starting a chain letter.[6]

Rather than attending high school for his senior year, Cuban enrolled as a full time student at the University of Pittsburgh. After one year at the University of Pittsburgh, he transferred to Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana and graduated in 1981 with a bachelor's degree in business administration.[13]

[edit] FamilyIn September 2002, Cuban married Tiffany Stewart, an advertising executive, in Barbados,[14] with a wedding reception at the American Airlines Center. Their first daughter, Alexis Sofia, was born on September 25, 2005; their second daughter, Alyssa, was born in 2007.[15] Tiffany and Mark also have a son born in early 2010.[2] The family lives in the Preston Hollow area of Dallas, in a 24,000-square-foot (2,200 m2) mansion.[16]

[edit] Early careerIn 1982, Cuban moved to Dallas, Texas. Cuban first found work as a bartender,[17][18] then as a salesperson for Your Business Software, one of the first PC software retailers in Dallas. He was terminated less than a year later, after meeting with a client to procure new business instead of opening the store.[19]

Cuban started a company, MicroSolutions, with support from his previous customers from Your Business Software. MicroSolutions was initially a system integrator and software reseller. The company was an early proponent of technologies such as Carbon Copy, Lotus Notes, and CompuServe.[20] One of the company's largest clients was Perot Systems.[21] In 1990, Cuban sold MicroSolutions to CompuServe—then a subsidiary of H&R; Block—for $6 million.[22] He retained approximately $2 million after taxes on the deal.[23]

In 1995, Cuban and fellow Indiana University alumnus Todd Wagner started Audionet, combining their mutual interest in college basketball and webcasting. With a single server and an ISDN line,[24] Audionet became Broadcast.com in 1998. By 1999, Broadcast.com had grown to 330 employees and $13.5 million in revenue for the second quarter.[25] In 1999, during the dot com boom, Broadcast.com was acquired by Yahoo! for $5.9 billion in Yahoo! stock.[26]

[edit] Business careerAfter the sale of Broadcast.com, Cuban diversified his wealth to avoid exposure to a market crash.[27] As of 2011, Cuban is No. 459 on Forbes' list of """"World's Richest People"""", with a net worth of $2.5 billion.[28] The Guinness Book of Records credits Cuban with the """"largest single e-commerce transaction"""", after he paid $40",[],0

I see what you mean, but I don't think you've quite put your finger on the problem. It seems to me that the later use of the term is a kind of long tail trailing from the mediaeval usage, so I don't find  it a problem talking about the former in an article about the latter, any more than I see it as a problem talking about film adaptations in articles about books. But you're right that there is something wrong with the hatnote. The problem is that by saying, """"This article is about the historical Principality..."""" we imply strongly that there exists a later principality, which should be covered in some other article. But there isn't; there's just a tail of usage. So you're quite right that we need to change the hatnote, though not I think to """"... is primarily about..."""" which still implies that there's some other principality. But then, do we even need the hatnote at all? We already have, as the last sentence of the introduction, """"The term principality is sometimes used in a modern sense to denote all of Wales, but this has no constitutional basis."""" Is it too much to hope that a confused person will read that far? If it is too much to hope, then what we need to change in the hatnote is the definite article (which is what implies that there exists some other Principality of Wales). We could do something like this: """"This article is about a historical entity (1216-1542). For use of the term """"Principality of Wales"""" to describe Wales after 1542, see below.""""

So they are at a totally different level and are distinct concepts. There may be other differences too. I myself am doing OR here, but my OR gets no place in the article. This source is being used on the strength of the OR that """"Love Jihad"""" is same/similar to """"Forced conversion"""" and this is how it becomes a violation of WP:OR policy, and that is why it should have no place in the article.
I am afraid using this source does involve synthesis. Here's how. The source is being used to convey the sense that """"Love Jihad"""" is an imaginary, baseless concept. This is being done on the strength of the OR that """"Love Jihad"""" and """"Forced conversion"""" are same/ similar & combining it with the source, is being used to convey that the source is saying that """"Love jihad"""" is a baseless concept. This is how it is synthesis. Actually, we have no source (except the opinion of WP eds, which are inadmissible in article space) that the two concepts are same/ similar + this source does not say that the issue of """"Love jihad"""" is baseless. It is only saying things about """"Forced conversion"""" etc. So, you see the synthesis part now. The source is being made to say things it does NOT say.

 Free super saver delivery alternatives - how to add content 

Hi. You deleted the """"Free super saver delivery alternatives"""" page I created yesterday. I thought it had enough context (it talked about Amazon's free super saver delivery system, when it ended and listed the current alternatives in the European market), but apparently more context was needed.
I am willing to edit the page and add more information (the whole idea was that other people could contribute as well), but it has been deleted and I cannot pick up where it was left off.

 Concerning point 1, Milburn is a student, by his own statement on his Wikipedia page, studying philosophy in Lancaster. What could possibly be insulting in saying that he is a student, while I myself have been ... (not relevant)? I expect some respect from someone who could be my own child if not student. 

 Concerning your point 2, please read my talk page, and you will see that rather than insulting Milburn, I have just stated facts. Milburn has been writing to me that he is a """"dedicated"""" and """"experienced"""" editor. Why should this have been relevant to me? I had already told him, in no uncertain terms, that I had left the issue to Stifle to decide upon. Yet, Milbrun kept writing to me that while Stifle was an experienced editor, he was also experienced. All these, in the face of the fact that I had never said him anything to the contrary! I had just said that we, i.e. I and Milburn, disagreed on the issue of the photograph of Michael Foot and therefore it was best if the issue was dealt with by someone else. Why had I to be constantly told things that he kept telling me? Read his messages and count the number of times that he has written to me that I did not understand certain things! 

 What could possibly be wrong with being a student in Lancaster? In point of fact, University of Lancaster has one of the best, if not the best, laboratories of law-temperature physics world-wide. If there are ten great low-temperature physicists in the world, thee of them are in Lancaster (they have over long periods of time had the world records of lowest temperatures ever achieved in laboratory; they were the main figures behind the dilution refrigerator, etc.). No, you are utterly mistaken if you believe that I meant something negative by referring to University of Lancaster - some of my best and most respected colleagues are working there (I even was their guest sometimes ago), one of them also a mathematician of great international standing.

 I hope I have made it abundantly clear that there is nothing disrespectful in my writings about J. Milburn as a person, as well as about his contributions (I simply do not know his and his contributions). I just happened to disagree with him on his tagging this photograph for deletion. That is why I suggested to him, already yesterday, that rather than arguing, we left the matter to be decided on by Stifle. That is all, insofar as I am concerned. It is J. Milburn who has kept filling my talk page with his messages after messages, telling me that I were wrong and that I did not understand certain things. """,[],0

I guess that """"ɑɾɹ̩"""" for """"otter"""" is a misprint in the source and should read """"ɑ̆ɾɹ̩"""".

Quote from Peter Sugar, """"The Early History and the Establishment of the Ottomans in Europe"""": There the Hungarian-Wallachian alliance was still in effect, and Bayezid I now moved against Mircea. Once again, many Christians, mostly Serbs, fought in his army, including Kraljevic (the son of the king) Marko, the hero of another famous Epic, who died not in that battle, but in the Battle of Arges which Bayezid fought with the Wallachians on May 17, 1395. Mircea appears to have been victorious militarily, but his forces and resources were so depleted that he had to acknowledge the loss of the Dobrudja, into which Bayezid moved Turkish garrisons. He also had to accept the status of an Ottoman vassal and pay regular tribute. This arrangement lasted until the Danubian Principalities regained their independence. Although it created problems for the Romanians, it saved them from the much harsher treatment that went with direct Ottoman rule, especially during the centuries of decline.  """,[],0

 Removed content 

I removed the following content which seems to be not particularly well-sourced, and a bit off topic - seems more related to a public relations type page, but I can't find exactly where it'd fit best, if anywhere at all.

""""==Two-Way Communication in Public Relations==
Two-way communication can be contrasted with [[broadcasting]], a one-way form of communication.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} Two-way communication uses communication to negotiate with the public, resolve conflict, and promote mutual understanding and respect between the organization and its public(s). 

There are different types of two-way communication in public relations; symmetric and asymmetric.

'''Two-way asymmetric'''
*Employs social science methods to develop more:'''Persuasive communication'''
*Generally focuses on achieving short-term attitude change;
*Incorporates lots of feedback from target audiences and publics;
*Is used by an organization primarily interested in having its publics come around to its way of thinking rather changing the organization, its policies, or its views.

'''Two-way symmetric public relations'''
*Relies on honest and open two-way communication and mutual give-and-take rather than one-way persuasion;
*Focuses on mutual respect and efforts to achieve mutual understanding;
*Emphasizes negotiation and a willingness to adapt and make compromises;
*Requires organizations engaging in public relations to be willing to make significant adjustments in how they operate in order to accommodate their publics;
*Seems to be used more by non-profit organizations, government agencies, and heavily regulated businesses such as public utilities than by competitive, profit-driven companies.Source: Managing Public Relations by James E. Grunig and Todd Hunt, 1984

 A violation of wiki rules 

Apparantley I have made a mistake called WP:OUTING in regards to sockpuppet user 86.40.192.203 whom had begun a discussion on the admin board against me with false charges. this sockpuppet had done this previously saying he was not a sock - yet again he oppened a second admin section against me with a new sock saying that he was someone different yet he was clearly the same guy (lying and saying he was a new editor)

i say in no uncertain terms that i had never heard of WP:OUTING and am sorry if i have violated this policy - but i should also say that all the information i posted i got from his own prior vandalism - essentially he outed himself - he vandalized a page to give his name and date of birth - which got reverted by another editor because it had nothing to do with the article he was vandalizing - his location i got from the wiki's own traceroute function that i thought we were allowed to use to prove sockpuppetrty68.231.15.56  

in one of his sockpuppet attacks here Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents#User talk:68.231.15.56 he states that """"This person has only recently been reported."""" this sentence implies that SOMEONEELSE reported me and yet the IP of the previous reporter is 86.40.107.69 which traces to the same location in Ireland - this is by definition sockpuppetry or the use of various IP's to do malicious intent without acknowledement of ownership68.231.15.56  
myself i have used this same IP for over 5,000 edits whereas i can see a pattern of daily vandalism and sockpuppetry of the 86.40 IP as far back as 2008 (man thats a lot of vandalism) endlessly ANON changing his IP to avoid block which i am betting he is already long ago blocked administratively68.231.15.56

No, not at all. I moved the request to the talk page of the administrator who added the protection back in 2011, so I hope he will get round to it sooner or later. Thanks, 679

 registration number for Boeing 299 is common knowledge.
 RAF Liberator B.I - ran visible s/n through Baugher page, verified though internet search.
 caption for SB-17G 44-83722 comes from my B-17 survivors page - this aircraft until recently was a survivors but has been parted out to get 3 other B-17's flyable - this aircraft was also used as an atom bomb ground test target.
 B-17G 43-38172 information can be found here: info about 43-38172 - tried doing this as a reference but could not get the link correct.

 trying to find the s/n for B-17E Pistol Packin' Momma

some of the information is just a matter of doing a google search - I like detailed captions and have tried to do a little clean-up of the captions - the order I like is Make and model and s/n on the top line (ie B-17G-30BO 43-XXXX), aircraft name right at the beginning of the second line then rest of info afterwards

"Gen Y begins in 1978 

Gen Y definitely begins in 1978. A previous author was right when she mentioned that people born in that era (1978-1984) are pretty in between, the same way people born in the early 1960s are between the classic generation X and the classic baby boom.

I think there is a difference between early Generation Yers (1978-1984) and late Generation Yers (1985-1994) but I don't think people born after about 1993 or 1994 can be included in Generation Y. Part of being Gen Y is being a child of a baby boomer. My parents were born in 1955 and I was born in 1990. The baby boomers are a pretty unified generation, and even my parents consider themselves to be part of a different generation than people born in the 1940s. My parents are children of the '70s, Watergate era, and came of age as adults during the late 1970s and early 1980s yuppie/disco era. Meanwhile, someone born in 1946 remembers the conformity of the 1960s and was in high school as opposed to grade school during the JFK assassination, and could have been drafted for Vietnam. They were old enough to take part in the antiwar protests or go to Woodstock. After about 1954 the boomers were children of the '70s, while before they were children of the '60s.

The same distinction exists between early and late Y. Early Y is a transitional group between Generation X and Generation Y, and their coming-of-age was characterized by alot of change (PCs, etc.) Also, their parents included more Vietnam vets and protestors, and hippies, while most people my age have parents whose adolescent preoccupations were disco and Led Zeppelin-type rock, Watergate and the oil crisis.

In the long run, though, you'll find that the WikiSyntax is a lot easier and faster than those other ways. Here are a few links to get you started:

How to write a great article

There are a lot of policies and guides to read, but I highly recommend reading over those first. If you have any questions, feel free to leave me a message on my talk page. Please be sure to sign your name on Talk using four tildes (~~~~) to produce your name and the current date, along with a link to your user page. This way, others know when you left a message and how to find you. It's easier than having to type out your name, right? )

I hope you enjoy contributing to Wikipedia. We can use all the help we can get! Have a nice day.

"Redlinks 

Allow me to outline a scenario. On an article about a TV program there is a redlink to an actor who appeared in a one-line role, and were know as Taxi Driver #2. The article is created, but as they have only ever appeared in one episode of a TV program where there part consisted of six words, the article is tagged with a CSD A7, another user removes the tag, the article is PROD-ed, on day 6.5 the PROD is removed the article goes to AfD, then five days later id deleted, because the actor fails the GNG and WP:ACTOR, the link turns red again. I would argue that Marshall's brothers and Carl the bartender may have appeared in enough episodes of HIMYM to get articles, but if HIMYM is all they have done then they fail the GNG. Given that day players are unlikely to ever bass the bar for GNG there is little point in redlinking every extra on HIMYM. The director of Zombieland deserves an article, Boy #1 in episode 9 of season 5 of HIMYM does not. Red links are useful, but redlinks everywhere do not help.

I also think a commissioned officer would have better things to do than to get involoved in any of this, but that’s just me.  But, you see CNFK probably now won’t touch this article with a ten foot pole.

Thank you. My problem was with labeling Achilles a """"sexual predator."""" Presumably Sommerstein will go on to identifying Daedaluas as the first aviator and Andromache as the first feminist. Without in any way denying the existence of sexual predation then and now, this particular use of the phrase strikes me as homophobic. It raises the question, which other (nonmurderous) sexual predators he is thinking of? Solon? Socrates? Aeschines? I can only view it as a homophobic remark directed at the Greeks in general. If so, that raises questions about the propriety of repeating it here.

To add to that, what information do we have on the respective ages of the two? Am I mistaken or was Troilus described as a boupais? It has been a while since I studied the topic, but I seem to recall he was nineteen when he died, one year short of the magic twenty needed to save Troy. Achilles, on the other hand, was sixteen when he shed his female garb and left with Oedipus to join the battle, I believe. And the killing is said to have happened early in the war. So what can Sommerstein be editorializing about? An adolescent preying upon an adult?

On a separate note, I never saw anything claiming that Achilles fell in love with Polyxena at the same time as with Troilus. Everything points to his lying in wait at the Lion fountain expressly to get the boy, not the girl (though it may be significant that she was sacrificed by the Greeks at his tomb).

One more thing - when the brothers (which ones?) of Troilus ride - too late - to his rescue, Achilles meets them in Apollo's temple with an unusual weapon: Troilus' head, which he is swinging around by the hair. It is such a gory detail, it would be a pity to not include it, I just no longer have the sources.  """,[],0

I have been deliberately not taking part in the current round of this debate because I have up till now had nothing new to add to it and to be frank, I didn't want to spend any more time on it. However since my name is coming up again I suppose I should say something. However Guettarda has already said most of what I would say, so if you've read his comments you already know most of my thoughts on the matter. I'll just comment on Manning's point about the first editor's spelling policy usage. Modern editors should bear in mind that, as Manning says, spelling/naming policy in those days was not quite the ironclad matter that it has now become. In fact the Manual of Style was originally someone's """"pet project"""". Initially following its precepts was optional. Hence many of us only adopted its prescriptions as it became increasingly obvious that not to do so would cause friction with those who took it as gospel. So at that time we did occasionally move articles from one regional variation to another. For instance I moved British """"Hoarding"""" to American """"Billboard"""" where it still remains without any complaint from anyone about """"first contributor"""". So, yes, """"first contributor"""" is an excellent way to solve these types of dispute. However it wasn't always and isn't always applied as the Hoarding/Billboard example demonstrates.   | Talk'' """,[],0

Rob Schnautz (WMF), what I meant by bringing up the Okeyes (WMF) example was that he was hired to complete a specific task, i.e. to get the community involved in the development of the New Page Triage (WP:NPT) and the Article Feedback Tool/Version 5. So his task was clear to us. Since he is the point man, the go-to guy. It's very easy to get information from him. He has the two """"tool"""" talk pages, his newsletters and holds """"office hours on IRC chat. And email, plus he responds readily and to the point on his talk page. There's no confusion. Everyone knows what's going on. If he can't give a direct answer, he might say something like """"I have no control over that; I'll ask the developers if your proposal is possible and get back to you."""" He is really clear about what he can do and what is out of his hands (up to the developers or WMF or technically not feasible etc.). 
I appreciate that you and Ldavis (WMF) are community liaison people, but I only learned about you recently and I'm not sure what sorts of things you cover or what it would be appropriate to contact  you or Ldavis (WMF) about. I found out accidentally about Dennis (WMF) – or what ever his name is – because I got involved with copyvio issues and I knew Moonriddengirl handled that kind of stuff, etc. That's the first I learned of {WMF) editors around.
My big beef (which I've gotten over) was a problem with an Online Ambassador. And I kept being told, every time I asked that """"it was being handled"""" by the Steering Committee. There was zero transparency, and I even had a post removed and got very bad vibs for asking questions from some of editors (I don't know what, if any,  positions they held in  the Education Program). So I am very surprised (and relieved) to read above: """"The Steering Committee in its most recent form wasn't responsible for overseeing anything except the online ambassador management and recruitment; as a result, the current status of online ambassador recruitment and management is largely unknown.""""  
So I welcome Pine's transparency and your acknowledgment (from my point of view) of reality, and I hope that this all works out. I know that some editors keep lists of course articles in their sandbox with the goal of fixing them all up.

 Archiving 

Are you sure all those pages need an archive setup ?   (open channel)

 Becky, yes.  Generally,  shouldn't be the only archiving on article talk pages.  If archiving is to be set up on those pages, it should be automatic archiving using .  Using that will still allow usage of OCA if there is a section with no timestamp or something else preventing automatic archiving.  Also, talk pages should generally not be archived if they are less than 75K in size.  Please go back through your list and change all of them to use  instead of . I'll also note that setting up archiving on talk pages like this usually only occurs once a discussion is started on the talk page to see if there is any objection, if there is consensus or no comments, or if the page is above the 250K threshold.  Thank you. — {{U|}} (e • t • c) 
 I have undone the addition of {{Archive basics}}. Can you help me understand the difference? I'm not sure I understand what you mean by """"OCA shouldn't be the only archiving on article talk pages""""? Using {{User:MiszaBot/config}} sets up automatic archiving. But {{Archive basics}} doesn't, it just sets up for use of OCA.  So if someone wanted automatic archiving, {{User:MiszaBot/config}} could still be added, right?

 Sorry about the delay. I got got up in some `stuff` that prevented me from replying sooner. OneClickArchiver is intended for archiving a user's own talk page.  It is also useful for archiving sections that bots don't archive automatically on other talk pages for various reasons.  While it is acceptable to use only OneClickArchiver on a user's talk page if that is what they wish and the size of their page doesn't get out of hand, bots should archive all other talk pages.

""""Between sections, there should be only a single blank line; multiple blank lines in the edit window create too much white space in the article.""""
It is obvious from both the previous quotation and last sentence of this one that the instruction """"there should only be a single blank line"""" is referring to the layout in the edit window and not that of the finally rendered page.
It is not at all obvious to me that the aircraft specification template is broken. The bug which produces the extra newline could well be in the rendering software rather than the template itself. But in any case, since your removal of the single blank line in the edit window is contrary to the style guidelines, I shall revert it.

He was barely mentioned in the original crisis, and only because his return to life was attributed to Superboy-Prime did his return elicit Infinite Crisis attention.  We have no idea how important he'll end up being in Countdown, since they change these things on the fly, and we'd be speculating if we were to state anything beyond what has happened.  Remember, this article should not be a substitute for reading the comics.  Now I do agree that character development, including the predicament with his parentage, should be addressed, however there's no need to make a wholesale change when addressing one situation at a time would be more productive as a fellow editor.
I disagree about 'inappropriate' language in the Death in the Family section. It looks fine to me, and since it links to the main article, were more detail can be read, there's no need to expand it further. 
I found your entry overly detailed in that it included many quotes, most of which that did not serve to do more than elaborate on what was already written, and it suffered from poor editing with your non-standard subheaders.  Much of the information was useful, and some, if trimmed down to manageable portions, would be useful. I like your elaboration on Catherine Todd, and while the intro paragraph is nice, that information is already in the preceding section, and repetition is unneeded.
I'd like to work with you and see how we could better include information in the article.  '''' (talk • contribs)'' """,[],0
"""

The main reason I was editing this page is because contributions by user """"Laveol"""" are offensive to the Macedonians. Lazar Kolisevski was a Macedonian, from Republic of Macedonia.
But still he does not deserver to have false information published under his English Wikipedia Page. I have to add that Macedonian Wikipedia Page about Lazar Kolisevski is what the English Page should be edited.
In general there are a lot of negation politics from the Macedonia's neighboring countries. Any of them would negate something about Macedonia: country, nation, language, culture, history, name and so on.
The information from Laveol is in line with this negation policies of those countries, in this case from Bulgaria. Bulgarian Nationalistic Propaganda is mainly based on negating the Macedonians as a separate nation, Macedonian as a separate language, same about the history.

Given the (non)popularity of Lazar Kolisevski in the modern times Laveol was able to edit the page and have that false information be viewable to Wikipedia users.
This was over that top and I decided to take action about it - Delete the false information, which is not only false, but is offensive to Macedonians and Macedonian People.

When you are Macedonian, your parents are Macedonian. Not Bulgarian or any other nationality.
When you talk about this sensitive topics, you cannot use books published in Bulgaria, as most of them are Propagandistic, working on the principles on 19th century Bulgarian Nationalistic Propaganda and Expansionism.

So the reason why that information by Laveol is deleted by me is that it is false and offensive to Macedonians.

 Apotropaic exposure of female genitalia 

The La Fontaine reference seems to be wrong in several of the quoted authorities, who state it is from La Fontaine's Fables, but the illustration they refer to is from La Fontaine's Nouvelles Contes. The story in question is Le Diable de Papefiguière. The illustration by Charles Eisen was copied to decorate a late 18th century porcelain cup and saucer, which I found illustrated at  (Accessed ) where it is described as follows:

Paris cup and saucer with scenes from La Fontaine's Contes 1785-90Dark blue ground, rich gilding of scrolls, foliage trails and vases. Reserves on the cup and saucer with grisaille scenes, identified in gilt writing on the underside: on the cup """"la jument du compere pierre"""", and on the saucer """"le diable de papefiguiere"""". No marks. Height of cup 6.1 cm, diameter of saucer 12.9 cm. Circa 1785-90.

This cup is of the Sèvres """"gobelet litron"""" shape. Although unmarked, the quality of the gilding indicates one of the top Paris factories at the period, such as the Duc d'Angoulême's (Dihl & Guérhard). The two painted scenes are taken from the 1767 edition of the Contes de La Fontaine, which was pirated from the famous 1762 Fermiers Généraux one, with engravings after drawings by Charles Eisen. Le Diable de Papefiguière is the story of a devil which comes to frighten a village…

The commentators state that the woman exposes herself to fighten the demon, but I think the story is less straightforward. I haven't found an English translation yet, but it seems to me to be a variation of a well-known folk theme in which Satan/devil/demons are tricked by a cunning peasant couple. An English example would be the folk song """"The Devil and the Feathery Wife"""".  | Talk """,[],0

I thought that diff is the main block of the storage mechanism of wiki, as
wiki does not have to save all the full page. Wiki needed to save only
diff of the pages. I think so.

Then by making line break as I am doing now, does my method make
the diff data of wiki SMALL? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Diff said that
Some editors find that adding manual line breaks improves the diff function.

"""

 First.Regarding the above very respectable commentary by the also very respectable editor , I feel I must affix this preliminary response, as for the upcoming weeks I won't be able to build a properly documented reply. You say that I  'unilaterally and without a source named Guevara as an official """"executioner"""".'  Not true, I did supply a reference  from a reliable source (Behind Che Guevara’s mask, the cold executioner Times Online (from The Sunday Times) September 16, 2007) that I later displaced downward. Yes, I am clearly not interested in the consensus of blatant leftist editors who regard Ernesto """"Che"""" Guevara as their personal hero, or idol, or totem, who believe he should be thought of as an exemplary human being. If user Nubiatech feels offended by the word 'bullshit', I may also feel offended when he/she childishly calls 'POV' my qualification of mass executioner, which by the way is an historical fact, as many sources prove, and which should be familiar terrain to . With all due respect, when he states that """"...none of the scholarly journals, or major biographies refer to Guevara primarily in such a manner"""", one wonders if he has gone through the immense mass of documentation available, for example, from Cuban exiles? The qualification to use should be mass murderer, which Guevara was, instead of the milder executioner. To display respect or deference toward an overt criminal is not only unjustifiable, it is plain hypocrisy.

 Second, the WP:NPOV guideline states:
 """"Balance
 Neutrality weights viewpoints in proportion to their prominence. However, when reputable sources contradict one another and are relatively equal in prominence, the core of the neutral point of view policy is to let competing approaches exist on the same page: work for balance, that is: describe the opposing viewpoints according to reputability of the sources, and give precedence to those sources that have been the most successful in presenting facts in an equally balanced manner."""", etc. 

 Let's briefly examine what the lead section states about """"El Che"""", to see if all viewoints are represented:
  he was an Argentine Marxist revolutionary,  (sounds respectable enough, perhaps chic, even classy)
 (he was a) politician,                       (respectable enough)
 (he was an) author,                          (sounds very respectable)
 (he was a) physician,                        (very respectable indeed)
 (he was a) military theorist,                (respectable enough)
 (he was a) guerrilla leader.                 (respectable for some)
 It should be obvious that there is no balance at all in the above qualifications; they all depict a character that ought to attract admiration, to say the least, hiding the """"insignificant"""" fact that he was a three-hundred-fold manslayer, even calling POV a reference to it. This is the logical consequence of the diligence with which leftist editors quickly delete anything that might mar their hero's image, and even cry foul (like  above) when anyone doesn't abide by their rules. This user even writes """"POV (not a fact) mentioned with due weight elsewhere on the article"""" in his reverting edit summary. Question: if it already is mentioned elsewhere, why there it's not considered 'POV', while within the lead section it is? The marrow of the discussion is that we are not talking of viewpoints here, we are talking about facts.  
 
 Third. I've been following the WP:Ignore all rules rule, mentioned by  in a prominent location in his user page, toward the objective of having Wikipedia tell the truth, which doesn't appear to be among the most important ones in this Encyclopedia (if it is, I'd appreciate anyone's help to tell me about it).

YOUR SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS AND ADDICTION

This is the most """"contructive"""" thing that can ever be contributed as it relates to you and your involvement here: Please stop and think about the depth of your sickness, sitting there, with your face glued to your computer screen, uncompensated day after day, week after week, for YEARS, tinkering with the biographies of people you don't even know, who actually are out living real lives while you are imprisoned by your addiction.  You have literally wasted years of your life with this lonely, self-destructive addiction and illness, which has been at the expense of living your own life.  The depth of your mental illness must make it difficult for you to see the extraordinary insanity of your actions and how your addiction has stripped you of the life that was given you.  

I know a few others have evaluated what you do here and laugh at you and your sickness.  It's something of an inside joke, and I guess few share it with you because they consider you hopeless.  That's not right either, and I'd ask them to please stop that and try to help you.  Don't laugh at this person behind their back and then just communicate with them on routine matters.  That lacks all caring for a person who has an obvious and very serious illness. Something is very wrong with him/her, and while it may not be for us to diagnose the exact problem, we should pause to help with advice.  Please share with him/her what we all know.  It's only humane to do so. 

I will do so now too:

Jerzy (or whatever your name isconsciously concealed, I'm sure, to keep your illness as private as possible), please consider some uncomfortable facts:  Years of your life have now been totally consumed and absolutely wasted by your deep, deep sickness and obvious addiction.  Please don't make excuses for yourself.  You cannot go on like this any longer.  You need to stop, and you need to stop today.  Reject this advice, and I worry that your sickness will probably only deepen and your addiction will waste whatever is left of your life.  Please stop.  It's over.  Enough.  Move on.  I do wish you the best and hope you will take this friendly advice seriously.  It will be the first and last time I share it, and I hope you know that I share it only with your best interests in mind.

Call Sign Meaning
I've been adding WISconsiN as a call sign meaning for quite some time now only to have it deleted by another user who INSISTS that the only possible meaning for the calls is the defunct WISconsin News newspaper.  As far as I know, there is no official documentation or credible source that states that the calls are a reference to the newpaper and the newspaper ALONE.  So who's to say the calls weren't also chosen because it was an abbreviation of the state's name?  There's plenty of examples of a station using calls with multiple meanings (such as WBBM-TV out of Chicago).  But my main sticking point is that WISN has referenced the calls while advertising itself as """"WISconsiN TV"""" (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JFirQUXfc8)  My theory is that the station chose to keep the calls after the newspaper folded because they referenced the state's name as well (the station had only been using the calls for a few years when the paper folded, so the """"name recognition"""" argument is moot).  But regardless of why they kept the calls, I think the fact that the station made a conscious decision to use them to brand itself as """"Wisconsin TV"""" deserves mention.  """,[],0

 Comparison between articles, as far as notability judgments, are often inconsistent. This happens when small numbers of people respond, and for gray-area topics it can admittedly be very arbitrary which way the decisions go. I'd say this article has maybe a 25% chance of surviving this AfD nomination. Most current cryptocurrency articles clearly meets GNG criteria; while Wikipedia articles like Dogecoin attract ever-accumulating non-RS references that should doubtless be removed, its core is based on articles in the LA Times, the Guardian, CNN, NBC News, CoinDesk, and half a dozen other established news sites. Vertcoin has only one, the International Business Times, but surprisingly that was deemed sufficient to meet GNG. There is never really a """"final process"""" on Wikipedia, since a removed article can be reproposed when new coverage comes out, or an approved article can be renominated for deletion a while later (though it can be frowned upon if it's done frivolously). If it is deleted, I would wait for more clearly reliable-source coverage of the topic before trying again. There's really nowhere else that I think Reddcoin would be usefully mentioned in Wikipedia at this point, as it just doesn't seem noteworthy to independent sources. Auroracoin caught a lot of press because of its nationalistic hook, and Mazacoin kind of followed on its coattails, but other 2014-launched alt coins have needed to do something fundamentally different to attract much notice (e.g., Ethereum). Alt coins like Vertcoin and Reddcoin seem to offer almost no innovation, just minor adjustments to standard parameters, and have little purpose other than the creator and early adopters trying to make money off later investors. Reddcoin's """"use it to tip people on social media"""" comes several years after Bitcoin was used to tip people on social media. Maybe it will catch on due to better UI integration; time will tell, but it hasn't caught on in independent media so far. One way to try and game the system is to cause a quick price jump, which can be done a number of ways; IBT, ForexMagnates, and ForexMinute are prone to provide coverage even for some temporary price manipulation, and being idiotic news sources they treat any spikes as signs of popularity.

"Abortion
One of the most difficult questions facing the right to life concerns the precise definition of the term ‘human life’- when exactly does ‘life’ begin and end? This controversial issue has its focus with the exact point of the commencement of human life. If an unborn child is treated as a living person, then it would be accorded the ‘right to life’ under the constitution. Thus, laws concerning abortion would effectively be rendered unconstitutional.

In Singapore, the Penal Code lays out the sanctions imposed if one does not comply with the Termination of Pregnancy Act- which limits abortion to patients who have not been pregnant for more than 24 weeks. In Malaysia, the Penal Code states that abortion is permissible within 120 days of conception, only if the pregnancy were to pose a threat to an expecting mother’s physical or mental health.  This shows that in these two jurisdictions, the states are unwilling to confer the ‘right to life’ to fetuses younger than the stipulated periods. The legislation there has accorded greater weight to the safety and security of expecting mothers who are threatened by their unborn child, and made provisions for their survival.[FIND YOUR JOURNAL^^]

This is in contrast with the approach taken in other modern jurisdictions, such as the Philippines, which provides that the state shall equally protect the life of the mother and the life of the unborn from conception. The Czech Republic also states that human life deserves to be protected before birth. It is notable that the latter two jurisdictions have a predominatly Catholic majority, who are staunchly pro-life. Therefore, chances of a  universal concensus on this issue are slim due to the difficulty in defining the beginning of life.[PROF**]

Celebrity side dish: John Malkovich brushes Bernie Madoff off of his shoulders
Tom Hanks' films are helping us 'Buck' up through tough times
He’s one of journalism’s most beloved and respected men, but someone appears to have it in for Tom Brokaw. 
Look up the former NBC News anchor on Wikipedia and you’ll find a review of his Emmy-winning reports, his best-selling books, his 20 honorary degrees. Until recently, you also would have found this sentence: 
“He had been married to Meredith Lynn Auld (a former Miss South Dakota and author) from 1962 until 2007, when an alleged affair between Brokaw and Diane Sawyer ended their marriage.”
The Brokaws’ marriage is very much intact (a Google image search shows them arm in arm at events throughout 2008 and 2009). Likewise, ABC News’ Sawyer remains happily married to director Mike Nichols.
A rep for Brokaw said he “burst out laughing” when he heard about the supposed affair. Contacted in the arctic reaches of Finland, Sawyer sent back word through her rep that, “as cute as Tom is, she laughed so hard she nearly fell off the icebreaker she’s traveling on.”
The purported affair, anonymously added to Brokaw’s bio on Feb. 27, was deleted after five days. Wikipedia Foundation spokesman Jay Walsh tells us the post “would constitute a ‘vandal edit’” but doubted the vandal could be found.
“It’s an open system,” says Walsh. “People may use it to exert their views. But the biographies of living people are most scrutinized by our volunteer editors. It’s incumbent on the Wikipedia Foundation to make sure they’re accurate.”
Walsh surmised that “someone with some agenda” was behind the post. Or maybe there’s more than one person. Clicking on the discussion page of Brokaw’s bio reveals attempts to slip in digs about his accent and personality. Wiki watchdogs rejected the insults, though not the unflattering picture of the newsman, which reminded one reader of “Clint Eastwood saying, ‘Do you feel lucky, punk?’ ”
The effort to smear Brokaw recalls the anonymous Wiki attack in 2005 on former assistant attorney general John Seigenthaler Sr., who, it was falsely claimed, masterminded the assassinations of both John and Bobby Kennedy.
Brokaw isn’t the only newsman targeted by Wiki vandals. “Some of our correspondents have stalkers who constantly post falsehoods,” says a source at another network news department. “We’ve had Wikipedia block posts from repeat offenders.”
But the unflappable Brokaw isn’t calling for any investigations. Through his rep he said, “This is beneath comment.”

"Aubrey is not considered the the litmus test of accuracy, but his comments are consistently quoted by biographers as accumulative supporting evidence, as it is assumed he had access to primary sources that have since disappeared and/or people who knew the people he wrote of. As with the majority of historical figures there is no direct evidence, but the supporting evidence is significant, and would certainly be considered enough to accuse someone of heterosexuality. In On Friendship and On Beauty Bacon addresses male love, or 'masculine love' as he significantly terms it in New Atlantis. Male love can obviously be platonic, but the term was also employed by the earliest writers who self-identified as what we now term homosexual, so it adds to the supporting evidence. Some of the referenced sources offer a deeper discussion of the context of Bacon's use of term and Elizabethan homosocial writing. It was I who originally referenced Mathews in the article as a scholarly source for the opinion that Bacon wasn't homosexual. In your change you retained Mathews, but deleted the other references I also supplied that show the spectrum of scholarly opinion. How true to type. I don't debate with sneaks, let alone bigots, so this is the only reply I'm going to offer you. But I do pity your patients.",[],0

how are you today? I've been looking over your fetal alcohol work, and it's pretty sharp. my dad's a doc, and he did a lot of work at johns hokins with that, he looked at it too. good work.

so, yeah the will mcwhinney article certainly has you all in a tizzy. I'm not looking to out anyone or anyhting, it's just gotten to the point that well, i think there's a reason, and other people too, to read about this fascinating community activist. I was telling Will beback, i've been a memebr of Sierra club since i was akid, my parents enlisted me and made some rather large donations in my name throughout my life, and i've done the same wiht my own children. It's a cool way to move things forward, like that movie, but hoefulyl much less trite. Anyhow.. what's the good word with you today? I think of our battles more like the old warner brothers cartoon with the coyote and the sheepdog, punching in before they set out to undermine one another. Because that's whats happening here, I'm actualyl writing some pretty solid stuff here, and you and will beback are bending over backwards to break rules and uphold them agaijnst me. Look, over at biff rose, there was a flargrant violation of the 3rr standard, and I pointed out that to Will beback that each time i made that violation, i was blocked and banned. i see that the person who did it this time was not blocked or banned. so you know, I've got a whole list of these that is being sandboxed by another ip, to follow up on, as i told will, you need to play fair for me to adhere to any standards you want to uphold. you can't just block an article, because true information is being disseminated through it. Well you can, but it's against the wiki rules, and so you are in violation, though i don't really think you care, anyhow, hope you keep your head above water, and I'l lsee you at the fights, so to speak.

You do realize that a vast body of literature and academic works refers to the places in Ukraine solely by their Russian names, especially in historical contexts? Hard as it may be for you to believe, but an average Western reader would not necessarily know that """"Kharkiv"""" and """"Kharkov"""" refer to the same place. Including Russian names in the lede helps clarify this point, makes cross-referencing historical literature and Wikipedia articles possible, and generally improves our readers' experience.

Nobody asked my opinion, but I'd like to mention two points that might be of use.

Nowhere in the main article and its classifications of FMG types to I find any reference to that. The practice is combined in Type I along with removal of the clitoris.

My second point is that the notion that women are often stronger proponents of FGM than men seems to me to be a dangerous one, because it seems to me that it misses an essential point: that in patriarchal societies, women often, and even systematically, collaborate with the male-dominated power structure.

We are not assessing the truth claims of a religion - we are assessing the historicity of an individual.

Proving a certain man existed ~2000 years ago is a long way from turning him in to a god!

Fortunately, his grave is covered by a slab containing a copy of a portion of his own plan.  However, the public usually only sees the copy of Ellicott's plan (or revision). 

As to the caption of the pictures on the Wikipedia pages, the people who have commented above should all visit the website describing the Library of Congress' holdings of L'Enfant's and Ellicott's plans in the Library's catalog at http://lccn.loc.gov/95860578.   The summary of the holdings states:   “Summary: Includes plans by Pierre L'Enfant (facsimile maps published in 1887 by the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey) and Andrew Ellicott (1792) and … “.  

In its most definitive site, the Library of Congress therefore identifies the plan in the Wikipedia pages as Ellicott’s plan.  I will leave it to others to revise the caption on the plan in the Wikepedia pages, as I do not want to revise it again myself.",[],0

COMPLEX SYSTEMS::

Attributess of a complex systems:

1. Hirarchy
2.Primitive component is arbitrary
3.Intra component linkages are stronger than inter component linkages
4.complex systems sub systems- in different combination
5.computer system- evoluated from simple system

                                                      Some basic concepts & strategies in the study of systems:

Abstraction: ``We have developed an exceptionally powerful technique for dealing with complexity. We abstract from it. Unable to master the entirety of a complex object, we choose to ignore the inessential details, dealing instead with the generalized, idealized model of the object"""" Wulf in Shaw, 1981). 
Formality: Rigor at each stage in the development of a system. 

Divide and conquer: Divide a complex problem into a set of simpler problems that can be solved. 

Hierarchical ordering: Order the simplification of the problem in ``divide & conquer"""" in hierarchies. 

Cohesion & coupling: Modularise the system such that interactions within components (cohesion) is maximised and interactions between components (coupling) is minimised. This way, the impact of errors, when they arise, is localised and does not cascade through the system. Diagnosis of offending components is also made easier. 

Information hiding: Each module (or subsystem) must have available to it just the information that is needed by it. 

Conceptual integrity: Consistency in design. 

Completeness: Ensuring that the design meets all the specifications. 

Logical independence: Emphasis on the statement of system objectives in terms of logical functions independent of physical implementation. 

Correctness & Efficiency: Correct in the sense that the design meets all the user requirements. Efficient in that the system accomplishes the objectives with minimum computing resources.""",[],0

Proposal

Look all I am saying is that the term """"Iranian"""" is a very loose term and people can get easily confused when they see this. Iranic would be a better term to use. Nontheless, there is no doubt that the Kurdish language is a bit similar to other languages such as Persian but there is also a difference as well. I am speaking as a Kurd myself. There is evidence that the Kurds have the highest chance out of all the other ethnic groups of being descendants of the Medes, all one has to do is look at lingustics. Although, it is also important to know that the Kurds have been in the middle east for a very very long time, and there have been many other empires/people as well. There have also been, for example, claims that Kurds are also descendants of the Gutians. It all boils down to what you believe, but to say that the Kurds are an Iranian people, is sort of going overboard. 

Kurds have been mentioned for a very longtime by many different people, including the Sumerians!

Nonetheless, I think there should be a change. I sort of agree with the Proposal above but I believe it can be better. Heres what I think should be written

Kurds are an ethnic group in the Middle East that inhabit adjacent parts of Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Syira known as Kurdistan. The Kurds speak a language known as Kurdish, which form a subgroup of the NorthWestern Iranian languages. The Kurds are known to be an Iranic people because of close linguistic and cultural ties with other Iranians. The Kurds are also known to be descendants of the Medes, according to many scholars.

Somewhere along those lines. Saying that Kurds are an """"Iranian ethnic group"""" is is vague, confusing, and somewhat mis-leading. What I wrote is a bit more clear and I wrote why they are considered an Iranic people with the sentences supporting it. Notice how I also said a language known as Kurdish. I do not know on what insane consensus that people decided it should be """"Kurdish language(s)."""" Kurdish is one language which is mainly based of two dialects, that are spoken by almost all Kurds. Those two dialects are Kurmanji and Sorani, both of which are highly similar. All Kurds regard their language as one. I am a Kurdish Sorani speaker and I can understand a Kurmanji speaker perfectly. Kurds in Turkey, Syria, and Half of Iraq speak Kurmanji. Then the other Half of Iraqi Kurdistan speak Sorani, with Kurds in Iran speaking Kurdish Sorani as well. There are also a few other dialects such as Hawrami which is spoken by about 10% of Kurds. Nonetheless, the Kurdish language is one language with 2 main dialects, both of which are highly similar to each other.

Failing to keep everything up-to-date
Hey Guys,
I seem to notice that we I'm absent, NOT all of the stats, season summaries for teams, etc. are staying up-to-date.

I mean that I feel stressful that I'm the only one updating Collingwood's season summary and nobody else. Also with season summaries, I want to discuss with all of you about how if we should have ALL of the season summaries in either a list or Template:AFLGameDetailed form (I might already dicuss this here).  Another problem is that Wikipedians has been updating articles in various formats in which it really annoys me when I update stats myself. e.g. With the Win/Loss table, I seem to notice that some Wikipedians have NOT bold the margin e.g. """"Port Adelaide 138"""" rather than the preferred format """"Port Adelaide 138"""". I notice that one lazy Wikipedian has decide to only update the Win/Loss table for their favorite team () rather that both teams ( and ). I mean the whole idea is to keep the article up-to-date, it is? Speaking about updating in various formats, I seem to notice the ladder progression gets messy and untidy all of the time. I means that we should discuss this problem together on this page and settle down on ONE simple format that all of us Wikipedians can follow. One Final thing I want to talk about in this is NOT changing/removing that already occurred in the past, I mainly notice that with the Win/Loss table were vandals keeping removing the bold text with home teams and sometimes with the Ladder were people make up they own stats. Its drives me insane and people must start looking at the Ladder on the offical website here in order to update the Ladder on Wikipedia. I hope that you fellow Wikipedians take me seriously on this issue as I am finding it stressful enough updating many stats myself.

There is no """"tug of war"""", the editor who restored the flag without consensus has this to say on the matter:

I can see right away that the official flag of Northern Ireland is going to cause controversy. There are two options: 1) That this is an encyclopedia, and we stick with the correct information or 2) We appease a minority of people by changing the flag to the defunct Northern Ireland flag.. some of whom will still not accept that flag either.

The emblem of the Northern Ireland Assembly is just that - an emblem used by that body. The proposed flags have not yet been adopted and so are not official.

This leads me back to the two suggestions above - the official flag of Northern Ireland (the Union Jack), or the unofficial Northern Ireland Flag. I do not want to purposely cause offence (though it seems to me that anyone likely to be offended by the official flag would also refuse to accept the existance of Northern Ireland in the first place), but I do want to include factual information in this encyclopedia.

Thus, a phrase like 'DC voltage' becomes 'direct current voltage' which doesn't make much sense at all.  Further, a 'DC current' becomes 'direct current current' which is redundant.  We EEs commonly refer to the DC component of a signal thereby equating the term 'DC' to the time average of a time varying signal or, if we are in the frequency domain, the 0 Hz component of the signal.  Additionally, we talk of DC voltage or current sources when we mean constant voltage or current sources.  Finally, we refer to DC circuits when we mean a circuit without memory (the voltages and currents in the circuit do not depend on past or future values of voltages and currents).

"Regnerus Study: Criticism 

Previous versions of this article unnecessarily multiplied references to criticism of the New Family Structures Study. 

First of all, this article is ostensibly about the Witherspoon Institute, not the New Family Structures Study, and it does not make sense to devote so much space to one study in what is otherwise a small article about an organization that has done many other things, as mentioned in the earlier paragraphs. 

Further, there is already a reference to the fact that the Study received criticism, down toward the end of the article. That same sentence also refers to the fact that many scholars also voiced praise for the Study, and thereby gives much more balance than the earlier discussion of criticism.

The fact remains that the Study was published by a peer-reviewed journal and was conducted at a major research university that has not condemned it. Some people voiced concerns to the same university that the study had not been conducted properly and the university found that the concerns did not merit further scrutiny. This Study has received the same vetting that countless other academic studies have received, including ones that came to very different conclusions.

In short, previous representations of criticism in this article about this Study were unnecessarily long, presented the Study in a very biased light, and made this article into a forum for voicing opinions that is properly handled in the academy through the methods of peer review and institutional review that the Study already passed. By ignoring those very processes of review such discussion does a disservice to Wikipedia's readers and suggests that the critics have a problem with the academic review processes as such, not the New Family Structures Study itself.",[],0

Eurasian and African mitochondrial DNA influences in the Saudi Arabian population

Macrohaplogroup M
Five of the eight M Saudi Arab lineages clustered into the M1 African haplogroup. Three of them had the 16359 transition that was diagnostic of the M1a East African cluster, and the remaining one belonged to the rare but widespread M1b1 cluster characterized in the HVSI region by 16185 transition and the 16190d deletion that had been identified in the northwest Africa, Jordan, and the Iberian Peninsula [27]. The other three M sequences belonged to Indian clades. One had the basic motif (16126, 16223) of the M3 haplogroup [28]. A second had the 15928 and 16304 transitions that defined haplogroup M25 [29], although this sequence [see Additional file 1] did not match any of the definite or putative M25 sequences found in India [29-31] or Pakistan [26].   

M1 originated in Africa (Semino)
The Genetic Legacy of Paleolithic Homo sapiens
Conversely, all non-M mtDNAs of non-African origin analysed so far carry 10873T. These data indicate that the **transition 10400 C>T, which defines haplogroup M**, arose on an African background characterized by the ancestral state 10873C, which is also present in four primate (common and pygmy chimps, gorilla and orangutan) mtDNA sequences.

 Kitzinger 

Regards reference 46, Framing abuse by Kitzinger, I got the book out of the library yesterday.  In the index, and on a brief flip through there is no mention of satan, satanic abuse, ritual abuse, the United States, religion, religious leaders, the satanic panic, courts, judicial systems, guilt, or anything else that really supports the sentence """"In America and Britain journalists framed the charges against the defendants as evidence of a moral panic and mass hysteria; child protection workers and social workers involved were bound by their professional codes of confidentiality and unable to comment on the specifics of the cases""""  There is focus on two cases - Cleveland and Orkney, both in the UK.  Based on my reading, the main focus of the book is on how the media's portrayal of the cases affected the public's perception of the event years later - not on guilt or innocence (though there is discussion on how the media left out and selectively reported details that were more convincing of the guilt of the parents.  If anyone on this talk page has read the book or is responsible for placing the text on the page, could you refer me to the page number (and chapter in case we have different versions) so I can verify?  Right now I'm tempted to excise the statement for having a) nothing to do with the U.S. b) nothing to do with the outcome of court cases and c) nothing to do with satanic ritual abuse.  If nothing else, it would allow the most nuanced, hopefully most neutral, portrayal of the book's contents.  Kitzinger appears to be very carefully saying nothing about the suspects' guilt or innocence, but I admit it is a cursory flip-through.

British Empire

Observation of Barack's bio or The Wiki-Obama standards of political content and style

I find it curious the Biography of Barack Obama has not one negative element to it.  It reads like a campaign mailer, with glowing remarks and fawning reverence for Mr. Obama.  In observing this article, and comparing in to, McCain's, Sarah Palin's (see typical example here   and other Republican office holders biography, the Republican ones are filled, with all sorts of negativity, red herring,  and plain old guilt by association.  Now if considering the precedents and standards, as they were up held on this article and vigorously defended by those with like """"Scjessey"""" and """"Wikidemon"""" and others I will conclude these are considered to be typical and reflect the consensus of those on Wikipedia.

Hi there, since you do not wish to have a united article representing all point of views and would like to stick to your point of view, I have no rights to prevent you other than that of a fellow wikipedian from South Asia. I have divided both the pages under discussion into two parts. One for Government point of view and one for refugee point of view. Since there is no neutral or united point of view, I will not be editing or discussing in those pages as actively as I have been doing. Besides, I can not prepare for my exams with no other than my fellow South Asian accusing me of fancy accusitions in place no other than wikipedia. Here is something that I have to say as regards your recent posts in this page:

Eukesh, you say all the right things, that we need a neutral article, that you want to be constructive, but at the end of it, it seems your mind is closed. You say you have not read the garbage from the nepalese press but that you have done a lot of research on the internet. isn't that where all that garbage is available? you say you want to be constructive but you are already fixed in your view that all the ethnic nepalese people in the camps are from bhutan. FYI, if they’re not from Nepal, it could be they are from india also, ie, not necessarily from Bhutan. being 'stateless' is not such a big thing in this region for which someone HAS to be blamed. you can count the number of poor nepalese without any documents who are finding their way to india every day. if ever there was a census to be done between nepal and india, you will find millions ‘stateless’ by your definition, definitely in the hundreds of thousands. is bhutan responsible for that? is it inconceivable to you that some of them might have made their way to bhutan? You conclude that it is 'entirely a Bhutanese issue' and nothing could be further from the truth. If nepal wasn't quite the economic basketcase it has become, maybe the rest of us in the region wouldn't have to deal with such an outflow of emigrants from your country.

 """"You say you have not read the garbage from the nepalese press but that you have done a lot of research on the internet."""" 

Please do not comment about Nepalese press in a nation where it has played a major part in bringing a revolution from a nation where there is virtually no press. The press here is not garbage. However, I did not care about the Bhutanese refugee case until I found that it was missing here and thought of writing about it.

I do not have a point of view. I agree that I have made some points which were offensive to some, but it was not intentional and were derived from the data. There was a speculation which was corrected later. I just posted what were there in websites of UNHCR and other global organizations which is something that is done in wikipedia. I have told you that people of Nepalese origin are found throughout the world. Many might be stateless. However, the reports of UNHCR shows otherwise in case of Bhutanese refugees. If you can change their view, please do. Otherwise stop editing with whatever you wish to write or in your own words, stop garbaging wikipedia.

Like the CFers, I don’t think voting defines this issue, particularly when critical information has been withheld from the voters.  Let's look at tat briefly...

From the Wiki page on pseudoscience we find:

“As it is taught in certain introductory science classes, pseudoscience is any subject that appears superficially to be scientific or whose proponents state is scientific but nevertheless contravenes the testability requirement, or substantially deviates from other fundamental aspects of the scientific method.[3]”

From the Wiki page on the scientific method, we find:

“Among other facets shared by the various fields of inquiry is the conviction that the process be objective to reduce a biased interpretation of the results. Another basic expectation is to document, archive and share all data and methodology so they are available for careful scrutiny by other scientists, thereby allowing other researchers the opportunity to verify results by attempting to reproduce them. This practice, called full disclosure, also allows statistical measures of the reliability of these data to be established.”

From my comments in the “Bias on both sides” section on this page we find:

The assertion that published studies on He in ‘cold fusion’ experiments came from air leaks, that this necessitates that the CFers perform ‘full disclosure’ on their experimental results and methods, and that that has not yet been done.

and:

The assertion that heavy metals found in cold fusion experiments comes from a) contaminants or b) improper analysis of data, that this necessitates that the CFers perform ‘full disclosure’ on their experimental results and methods, and that that has not yet been done.

And from my other comments on calorimetry (incl. edits to the CF  Wiki page), we find:

The assertion that apparent excess heat arises from an analytical method problem, that the CFers exclude these concerns based on a dislike of a proposed speculative physical/chemical mechanism that might or might not be a source of a calibration constant shift problem, while ignoring the mathematical fact that a 1-3% change in cal. constants can account for the large majority of such heat claims.  One fundamental aspect of the scientific method is the concept that if two alternative explanations exist for a given set of observations, then the situation is undefined and more new work must be done designed to test each alternative and distinguish between the two, because two distinct, conflicting explanations for a phenomenon can’t both be correct.  Failure to do that substantially deviates from other fundamental aspects of the scientific method.  Failure to incorporate a viable alternative into experimental protocols produces a biased interpretation of the results.

Seems to me we need a new vote…     18:48, 22",[],0

"The Sangharaj holds authority over all monks ordained in the Thai sangha, whether inside or outside of Thailand.  For example, it is through the Sangha council that monks are authorized to perform ordinations and through which the title of 'Somdet' is awarded.  However, the two monasteries you mention are slightly different from most Thai wats you find outside of Thailand.  Most Thai wats, for example here in San Francisco, are closely associated with the Sangha council which is heavily involved in the wat's operation.  (I think)

Amaravati and Abhayagiri pretty different because they are 'forest monasteries' and also because they are for Westerners.  Most forest monasteries tend to be fairly uninvolved with the formal Sangha administration, and doubly so the Westerners.  The various branches of Wat Nanachat tend to do their own thing, but still are bound by the Thai Sangha in certain ways.  For example, only Ajahns Sumedho and Pasanno are authorized by the Sangharaj to perform ordinations, so all ordinations within the branches of Wat Nanachat in the West are done by one of those two, whether here in America or in Australia, etc.",[],0

 Urartu case 

First of all, I would like to complain about spying and stalking on all my activities from users like Nareklm. The latter recently interfered in page """"Request of Assistance"""" and removed a reference to personal attack which I reported to PAIN. I realize that my link is not valid anymore since it was archived. But case was reported - I have been insulted by Eupator.

Now - about Urartu.

First - I made my references. Those users  have been removed references. Wikipedia has a quite strong guidance about that. Further - about relevancy of my text, actually not only mine - there is other users who supported me)

I argue that section of """"Ethnic Composition"""" in page Urartu and page """"Antiquity"""" in page Armenia in its current version imply ethnic continuity and strong bonds between people who lived in Urartu (Academicians for example use term 'people of Urartu') and Armenians, who (sources I quoted say) moved in Urartu in 7-6 BC. My argument is not only about language diferrences. It is about ethnic and cultural ones. My arguments are on 'Request of Assistance' page. 

I'd like to quote professional historian about Urartu-Armenia nexus:

Philip L. Kohl, Clare Fawcett. Nationalism, Politics and the Practice of Archaeology (New Directions in Archaeology). Page 157: """"No less problematic are heavily slanted interpretations of the Urartian kingdom, the first historically attested state in Transcaucasia (ninth to seventh centuries BC). Armenian chauvinists must explain why this state, a worthy adversary of the neo-Assyrian Empire of northern Mesopotamia and one that expanded over much of """"historic Armenia,"""" composed its royal cuneiform inscriptions in Urartian, a non Indo-European ( i.e., non-Armenian) language, related to Hurrian and ancestral to the Northeastern Caucasian family of languages spoken today by different peoples in Daghestan, Chechenia, and Ingushetia (see Jankowska 1991:231). Reasonable historical hypotheses can be advanced for a Proto-Armenian component to this kingdom, and there is a real sense in which the Armenians are the cultural heirs of Urartu, but an essentialist view of Armenian culture which equates it precisely with the Urartian kingdom cannot be sustained. One must distinguish between popular and professional Armenian interpretations of Urartu, the latter being subtler and more difficult to evaluate. Thus, popular reference to the """"Piotrovskii problem"""" is based on the fact that B.B. Piotrovskii, the late Director of the Hermitage in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) and former head of the excavations at Karmir Blur (the ancient Urartian capital of Teishebaine now located within the city of Yerevan), had quite reasonably maintained that the mighty Urartian Iron Age kingdom did not constitute the first Armenian state for the reasons stated above; the """"problem"""" only existed for those who wanted Armenians always to have lived in and controlled """"historic Armenia"""" until the later ravages wrought by Romans, Persians, Arabs, and Turks. More discriminating professional archaeologists, who may accept the reasonable theory that the ethnogenesis or formation of Armenian culture occurred during post-Urartian Achaemenid times, extol the might of the Urartians and see them exercising political control over most of eastern Anatolia, western Iran, and Transcaucasia; in this respect they remain the direct precursors of the Armenian kingdom under Tigran II.""""

Speedy deletion of Trent Kuhl
 A tag has been placed on Trent Kuhl requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page that has been nominated for deletion (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

http://blogs.news.com.au/heraldsun/andrewbolt/index.php/heraldsun/comments/climategate_how_the_cabal_controlled_wikipedia

One person in the nine-member Realclimate.org team — U.K. scientist and Green Party activist William Connolley — would take on particularly crucial duties.

Connolley took control of all things climate in the most used information source the world has ever known – Wikipedia. Starting in February 2003, ... Connolley set to work on the Wikipedia site. He rewrote Wikipedia’s articles on global warming, on the greenhouse effect, on the instrumental temperature record, on the urban heat island, on climate models, on global cooling. On Feb. 14, he began to erase the Little Ice Age; on Aug.11, the Medieval Warm Period. In October, he turned his attention to the hockey stick graph. He rewrote articles on the politics of global warming and on the scientists who were skeptical of the band. Richard Lindzen and Fred Singer, two of the world’s most distinguished climate scientists, were among his early targets, followed by others that the band especially hated, such as Willie Soon and Sallie Baliunas of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, authorities on the Medieval Warm Period.

All told, Connolley created or rewrote 5,428 unique Wikipedia articles. His control over Wikipedia was greater still, however, through the role he obtained at Wikipedia as a website administrator, which allowed him to act with virtual impunity. When Connolley didn’t like the subject of a certain article, he removed it — more than 500 articles of various descriptions disappeared at his hand. When he disapproved of the arguments that others were making, he often had them barred — over 2,000 Wikipedia contributors who ran afoul of him found themselves blocked from making further contributions… In these ways, Connolley turned Wikipedia into the missionary wing of the global warming movement.

Threat is a noun, and defined as:

1. An expression of an intention to inflict pain, 
   injury, evil, or punishment.
2. An indication of impending danger or harm.
3. One that is regarded as a possible danger; a menace.

Fair use rationale for Image:AlexKiddManga.png

Thanks for uploading or contributing to Image:AlexKiddManga.png. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use. Suggestions on how to do so can be found  here.

Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. Using one of the templates at Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline is an easy way to insure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template.  Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page. 

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the """"my contributions"""" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting """"Image"""" from the dropdown box.

Larry Sanger has the same diagnosis that i do. I have more to offer
in terms of how to solve the problem. But not whilst being blocked
by trolls and their pet admins for making the effort.

""""Wikipedia has, to its credit, done something about the most serious trolling and other kinds of abuse: there is an Arbitration Committee that provides a process whereby the most disruptive users of Wikipedia can be ejected from the project. 

But there are myriad abuses and problems that never make it to mediation, let alone arbitration. A few of the project's participants can be, not to put a nice word on it, pretty nasty. And this is tolerated. So, for any person who can and wants to work politely with well-meaning, rational, reasonably well-informed peoplewhich is to say, to be sure, most people working on Wikipediathe constant fighting can be so off-putting as to drive them away from the project. This explains why I am gone; it also explains why many others, including some extremely knowledgeable and helpful people, have left the project. 

The root problem: anti-elitism, or lack of respect for expertise. There is a deeper problemor I, at least, regard it as a problemwhich explains both of the above-elaborated problems. Namely, as a community, Wikipedia lacks the habit or tradition of respect for expertise. As a community, far from being elitist (which would, in this context, mean excluding the unwashed masses), it is anti-elitist (which, in this context, means that expertise is not accorded any special respect, and snubs and disrespect of expertise is tolerated). This is one of my failures: a policy that I attempted to institute in Wikipedia's first year, but for which I did not muster adequate support, was the policy of respecting and deferring politely to experts. (Those who were there will, I hope, remember that I tried very hard.) 

I need not recount the history of how this nascent policy eventually withered and died. Ultimately, it became very clear that the most active and influential members of the projectbeginning with Jimmy Wales, who hired me to start a free encyclopedia project and who now manages Wikipedia and Wikimediawere decidedly anti-elitist in the above-described sense. 

Consequently, nearly everyone with much expertise but little patience will avoid editing Wikipedia, because they willat least if they are editing articles on articles that are subject to any sort of controversybe forced to defend their edits on article discussion pages against attacks by nonexperts. This is not perhaps so bad in itself. But if the expert should have the gall to complain to the community about the problem, he or she will be shouted down (at worst) or politely asked to """"work with"""" persons who have proven themselves to be unreasonable (at best). 

This lack of respect for expertise explains the first problem, because if the project participants had greater respect for expertise, they would have long since invited a board of academics and researchers to manage a culled version of Wikipedia (one that, I think, would not directly affect the way the main project is run). But because project participants have such a horror of the traditional deference to expertise, this sort of proposal has never been taken very seriously by most Wikipedians leading the project now. And so much the worse for Wikipedia and its reputation. 

This lack of respect for expertise and authority also explains the second problem, because again if the project participants had greater respect for expertise, there would necessarily be very little patience for those who deliberately disrupt the project. This is perhaps not obvious, so let me explain. To attact and retain the participation of experts, there would have to be little patience for those who do not understand or agree with Wikipedia's mission, or even for those pretentious mediocrities who are not able to work with others constructively and recognize when there are holes in their knowledge (collectively, probably the most disruptive group of all). A less tolerant attitude toward disruption would make the project more polite, welcoming, and indeed open to the vast majority of intelligent, well-meaning people on the Internet. As it is, there are far fewer genuine experts involved in the project (though there are some, of course) than there could and should be. 

It will probably be objected by some that, since I am not 100% committed to the most radical sort of openness, I do not understand why the project that I founded works: it works, I will be told, precisely because it is radically openeven anarchical. 

I know, of course, that Wikipedia works because it is radically open. I recognized that as soon as anyone; indeed, it was part of the original plan. But I firmly disagree with the notion that that Wikipedia-fert",[],0

Our first collaboration article for 2009 is Cockatoo—a well-known Australasian family of parrots.  The article is already in reasonable shape, thanks to early efforts by a number of contributors, and with a little more work, we should be able to get it to GA/FA status.  Can we get our first """"group star"""" for the year on this one?
On a related note, be sure to vote for April's collaboration article, which will be chosen on March 31.  If none of the existing nominations interest you, consider adding a new one!
Please be sure to mark any featured lists as FL-class rather than FA-class.   All of our current featured lists have been moved into this new(ish) category.
Beginning in April, we'll be removing from our """"active participants"""" list the name of any editor who hasn't edited on Wikipedia for 6 months or more, putting them instead into a """"retired editors"""" section.  (Please note that will be easy to move yourself back into the active category if you start editing again after an extended absence.)  This should help us to better evaluate our project's editor retention and make for more efficient newsletter delivery. Videos
We all know the old adage """"A picture is worth a thousand words.""""  And if that's true, videos are probably worth 10,000!  They're a great way to add information to articles—for instance by showing behaviours that are hard to explain with text or static pictures.  They can also include audio, adding a dimension unavailable in a photo. If you don't have your own video camera, you can still help the project by finding and requesting videos from others who have already taken them (checking, for example, at Flickr, YouTube or The Internet Bird Collection).  If you have questions about how to upload videos, several project members, including  or , may be able to help. Newsletter challenge
 took up the last newsletter's challenge, and started our article about distraction displays—behaviors used by birds to lure or drive potential predators away from nests or young.  This month, we're looking for someone to start an article about acoustical luring, which is a method used by some predatory birds to lure potential prey into reach.  The person who creates this article and gets it beyond a mere stub level will be mentioned in the next newsletter.Got a suggestion?  A correction?

To circumvent public opinion, Blair's government conducted a poll of corporations which turned up a 90% favorable return toward adoption. The suggestion has been made- and is being debated as part of a potential agreement- to allow Scotland, Wales, N. Ireland and England to issue seperate euro coins in order to preserve the cultural connection to their currency. Personally, I don't think the ECB will go for this, but stranger things have happened. There is already a confusion factor (eurozone wide) regarding euro coin designs- introducing 9 more designs between now and 2010 will only serve to compound the problem. There would be 200 different legal tender coins in circulation! This doesn't take into account the new common design or the 2 euro commemoratives.

I'll quote the relevant part for you:

Here's my best guess for who Slim Virgin's first account was:

I'll say why:

1) Created the Yvonne Fletcher article, just 1 minute after he had made his first edit to Pan Am Flight 103
2) Made many edits to Yvonne Fletcher article insisting that a marksman killed her, and pushing many conspiracy theories about it.  Encouraged links to Joe Vialls' sites on it.
3) Received a new user message on 14 December 2003, yet first edit wasn't until 17 January 2004, suggesting Darkaddress was in some trouble, and had edits wiped from history.
4) Basically stopped editing in July 2004.  Only made 2 edits since Slim Virgin started in November 2004.  These two edits were minor:  and , and were 6 months apart from each other.  This is suggesting that Darkaddress had a sock puppet.

Of course, this is all going with the theory that Slim Virgin is Joe Vialls.  It is just a theory.  It is at this stage a very thin theory, and I am hoping for some more meat towards it.  However, Joe Vialls is the only person I can think of who is an expert on the Lockerbie Bombing and also is anti-Jews.  And, make no mistake, Joe Vialls is an expert on the Lockerbie Bombing.  He is also an expert on Yvonne Fletcher.  Indeed, he is an expert on Jews themselves.  He just happens to hate them, and blame them for everything.  Joe Vialls is also a former policeman turned detective turned journalist and conspiracy theorist.  Supposedly Joe Vialls died last year.  Joe Vialls is extremely secretive, and nobody really knows who he is.  He also likes to sign his name """"JoeVialls"""".  A bit like """"SlimVirgin"""" eh.

A little clutching at straws, I must admit, but it is at least a theory that fits.  Let's see if anyone can come up with a better one.""",[],0

The Crying of Lot 49

ONE summer afternoon Mrs Oedipa Maas came home from a Tupperware party whose hostess had put perhaps too much kirsch in the fondue to find that she, Oedipa, had been named executor, or she supposed executrix, of the estate of one Pierce Inverarity, a California real estate mogul who had once lost two million collars in his spare time but still had assets numerous and tangled enough to make the job of sorting it all out more than honorary. Oedipa stood in the living room, stared at by the greenish dead eye of the TV tube, spoke the name of God, tried to feel as drunk as possible. But this did not work. She thought of a hotel room in Mazatlan whose door had just been slammed, it seemed forever, waking up two hundred birds down in the lobby; a sunrise over the library slope at Cornell University that nobody out on it had seen because the slope faces west; a dry, disconsolate tune from the fourth movement of the Bartok Concerto for Orchestra; a whitewashed bust of Jay Gould that Pierce kept over the bed on a shelf so narrow for it she'd always had the hovering fear it would someday topple on them. Was that how he'd died, she wondered, among dreams, crushed by the only ikon in the house? That only made her laugh, out loud and helpless: You're so sick, Oedipa, she told herself, or the room, which knew.

The letter was from the law firm of Warpe, Wist-full, Kubitschek and McMingus, of Los Angeles, and signed by somebody named Metzger. It said Pierce had died back in the spring, and they'd only just now found the will. Metzger was to act as co-executor and special counsel in the event of any involved litigation. Oedipa had been named also to execute the will in a codicil dated a year ago. She tried to think back to whether anything unusual had happened around then. Through the rest of the afternoon, through her trip to the market in downtown Kinneret-Among-The-Pines to buy ricotta and listen to the Muzak (today she came through the bead-curtained entrance around bar 4 of the Fort Wayne Settecento Ensemble's variorum recording of the Vivaldi Kazoo Concerto, Boyd Beaver, soloist); then through the sunned gathering of her marjoram and sweet basil from the herb garden, reading of book reviews in the latest Scientific American, into the layering of a lasagna, garlicking of a bread, tearing up of romaine leaves, eventually, oven on, into the mixing of the twilight's whiskey sours against the arrival of her husband, Wendell (""""Mucho"""") Maas from work, she wondered, wondered, shuffling back through a fat deckful of days which seemed (wouldn't she be first to admit it?) more or less identical, or all pointing the same way subtly like a conjurer's deck, any odd one readily clear to a trained eye. It took her till the middle of Huntley and Brinkley to remember that last year at three or so one morning there had come this long-distance call, from where she would never know (unless now he'd left a diary) by a voice beginning in heavy Slavic tones as second secretary at the Transyl-vanian Consulate, looking for an escaped bat; modulated to comic-Negro, then on into hostile Pachuco dialect, full of chingas and maricones; then a Gestapo officer asking her in shrieks did she have relatives in Germany and finally his Lamont Cranston voice, the one he'd talked in all the way down to Mazatlan. """"Pierce, please,"""" she'd managed to get in, """"I thought we had""""

""""But Margo,"""" earnestly, """"I've just come from Commissioner Weston, and that old man in the fun house was murdered by the same blowgun that killed Professor Quackenbush,"""" or something.

""""For God's sake,"""" she said. Mucho had rolled over and was looking at her.

""""Why don't you hang up on him,"""" Mucho suggested, sensibly.

""""I heard that,"""" Pierce said. """"I think it's time Wendell Maas had a little visit from The Shadow."""" Silence, positive and thorough, fell. So it was the last of his voices she ever heard. Lamont Cranston. That phone line could have pointed any direction, been any length. Its quiet ambiguity shifted over, in the months after the call, to what had been revived: memories of his face, body, things he'd given her, things she had now and then pretended not to've heard him say. It took him over, and to the verge of being forgotten. The shadow waited a year before visiting. But now there was Metzger's letter. Had Pierce called last year then to tell her about this codicil? Or had he decided on it later, somehow because of her annoyance and Mucho's indifference? She felt exposed, finessed, put down. She had never executed a will in her life, didn't know where to begin, didn't know how to tell the law firm in L. A. that she didn't know where to begin.

One final point that may not be apparent to contemporary readers.  We have a hard time understanding today why anyone would think a spherical earth implies habitation on the far side...after all, the entire backside could be endless ocean, right?  Or barren desert?

It seemed incomprehensible to such men that God would create an entire """"second world"""", below and unreachable from the first...and leave it wholly empty.

 * this happens after one of the siblings had been chained/tied up in their bedroom by the victims, then freed by the other sibling
 * years later the murderous sibling (in both cases the brother) is still psychologically scarred by the event
 * and murders and unnatural phenomena arising from the ghost-catching mirror and its shards ensue.

 Signpost exit poll  
Dear Wikipedian, you recently voted in the ArbCom election.  Your username, along with around 155 other usernames of your fellow Wikipedians, was randomly selected from the 2000+ Wikipedians who voted this year, with the help of one of the election-commissioners.  If you are willing, could you please participate (at your option either on-wiki via userspace or off-wiki via email) in an exit poll, and answer some questions about how you decided amongst the ArbCom candidates? 

  If you decide to participate in this exit poll, the statistical results will be published in the Signpost, an online newspaper with over 1000 Wikipedians among the readership.  There are about twelve questions, which have alphanumerical answers; it should take you a few minutes to complete the exit poll questionnaire, and will help improve Wikipedia by giving future candidates information about what you think is important.  This is only an unofficial survey, and will have no impact on your actual vote during this election, nor in any future election.  

  All questions are individually optional, and this entire exit poll itself is also entirely optional, though if you choose not to participate, I would appreciate a brief reply indicating why you decided not to take part (see Question Zero).  Thanks for being a Wikipedian

Dear Wikipedian, please fill out these questions  at your option via usertalk or via email, see Detailed Instructions at the end of the twelve questions  by putting the appropriate answer in the blanks provided.

The method used is the Algebraic Topology of PDE's formulated by A. Prástaro in a series of early published works on the geometric theory of PDE's and the characterization of their global solutions by means of suitable bordism groups.

In particular in [1] and [2] it is proved the following theorem.

Theorem [Integral h-cobordism in Ricci flow PDE's]
The Ricci flow equation for n-dimensional Riemannian manifolds, admits that starting from a n-dimensional sphere S^n, we can dynamically arrive, into a finite time, to any n-dimensional homotopy sphere $M$. When this is realized with a smooth solution, i.e., solution with characteristic flow without singular points, then S^n is diffeomorphic to M. The other homotopy spheres \Sigma^n, that are homeomorphic to S^n only, are reached by means of singular solutions.
In particular, for n belonging equal to 1,2,3,4,5,6,  one has also that any smooth n-dimensional homotopy sphere M is diffeomorphic to S^n. In particular, the case n=4, is related to the proof that the smooth Poincaré conjecture is true.",[],0

"I am not sure how this makes it any less cumbersome.

Now the article has Melee with its listings for armour and weaponry, then Mage with its listings for armour and weaponry, and then Range with its listings for armour and weaponry, which is still a total of six.  We have gone from two main headings to three main headings.

The direction we want to go needs to be decided.  Do we want to talk about armour and weaponry as topics and then break them down between the various classes?  Do we want to talk first about the class (styles) of combat and then break them down between armour and weapons?

""""Unlike trolls who vandalize articles, the majority of the damage caused by those misusing process is indirect. Generally it is best to simply state your opposition and leave it at that. 

In many cases someone else has already gone through an explanation, and you can simply say you agree. If a nomination or listing is obviously going to fail, """"piling on"""" explanation after explanation or personally attacking the nominator is not going to change anything; the listing or nomination will fail anyway. 

If the number of listings starts getting excessive (even if they are on separate pages) then you might want to use the dispute resolution process. Dispute resolution does take a while, though.

Sorry, but it strains credulity (mine, anyway) to believe that you didn't realize that the Adam Mickiewicz article was the subject of a dispute among Lithuanian and Polish editors with whom you are well-acquainted until the moment before you were going to hit save, as you state here .

 Edit request from Jayjoanz, 14 February 2011 

Please add the following information to the """"Public Image"""" section of Lady Gaga's page:

Lady Gaga's public perception is always amongst the most controversial of topics in popular culture. Debate about her style and influence on youth stems from her unceasing desire to walk the thin line between daring and inappropriate. The pop stars ability to command the attention of her fans and critics is unmatched and with a growing list of hit records she has solidified herself as a marketable brand. Her 2.8 million Twitter followers and 5.2 million Facebook fans represent evidence of her ability to move product (Hampp, 2010). With opposing ideals about the negative or positive impact of her music, fashion, and public statements there is little question that the benefits of her talent outweigh the detriments. Her fan base and customer base are similar in nature because they are both drawn to her outspoken and outrageous personality (Hampp, 2010).

Works Cited
Hampp, Andrew. """"GAGA, OOOH LA LA: WHY THE LADY IS THE ULTIMATE SOCIAL CLIMBER."""" Advertising Age 81.8 (2010): 42. Communication & Mass Media Complete. EBSCO. Web. 13 Feb. 2011.

  

I think that section already basically says that.  Also, we don't list how many Twitter followers and Facebook followers a person has because there's no way to really verify that information  are those real people?  Are there any sockpuppet accounts?  Anyway, the article basically says all that already.   

 Drug-taking? 

Shouldn't something be said about her drug taking. She admitted it on her CBS 60 Minutes interview that she smokes A LOT of pot while writing music, while drinking whiskey. It's mentioned on other musician's articles, so why not here? 90.193.141.136  
I'm surprised her former cocaine habit isn't mentioned here as well, seeing as she's talked about it in multiple places now (60 Minutes, Vanity Fair). 128.163.242.6  

 Edit request from Cvachov, 18 February 2011 

1986–2004: Early life

Lady Gaga was born Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta, to an Italian American family, in New York City on March 28, 1986,[11] 

...in Yonkers. NY...

Yonkers is it's own city and not part of New York City, it is located in Westchester County, not one of the five boroughs. 

  

 Per the cited source, """"Birth Place: New York, NY."""" It does not state Yonkers. If you check the talk page history, you'll also see that this issue has been researched and discussed at end, and established consensus is that she was not born in Yonkers. —' (talk) 

 Early Management requested addition 

Frank Fredericks, a fellow freshman at NYU, recognized Stefani's talent when they competed against each other in a campus talent show.  Fredericks began managing Stefani in the Spring of 2005, booking her shows at the nearby club the Bitter End.  They worked together for over year, until she began working with producer Rob Fusari.

 Thermological explanation of galling 
Hi. I´m responsible for most of the text regarding the galling phenomenon presently found in the Wiki archive. 

My opinion of the galling phenomenon is the following. Galling is highly connected to thermal or pressurized influenced contact and the interaction between the mating surfaces. The temperature or pressure around penetrating objects is higher for small and sharp objects compared to larger blunt objects due to higher acceleration. This means that phase transition can take place even in the initial build up process and onset of adhesive material transfer and galling. It was clear that a change in material behaviour, which increased resistance for further advancement, took place around sharp edges even in the build up process where attached material was insignificant. My conclusion, there is a connection between the attached material and the geometrical situation around penetrating objects and developed pressure and temperature in the contact zone. 
The theory about electrolyte and a galvanic exchange is interesting but in my research using a SOFS (slider-on-flat-surface) tribo-tester, revealed a clear difference between exhibited contacts found in the tracks after testing. An electrolyte and a galvanic exchange should always be present, which was not observed using the above equipment. 

If you are interested in the argumentation read the reference and perhaps include it as a reference in the Wiki text about galling.

Roc Nation Template
Hi there ,

I'm sure you a nice person, but I would like to know the reason of why you have removed just the name of Tinchy Stryder and no other names on the Template:Roc Nation just under reason of """"Reverting edits by block-evading sockpuppeteer"""" when In fact I have been unblocked since 16 September 2011, and all the edits I have made to the Template:Roc Nation since the end of my ban have all been in good faith and correction of information and also of other WPA edits I have made from the knowledge I have on a specific WPA, have been made after my 1 month ban from the 16 August 2011 to 16 Sep 2011. So I just don't understand what you mean by """"block-evading sockpuppeteer"""" and when Tinchy Stryder's name was on the template way before I had made any edits to the template, and all I persume is that the reason why Tinchy Stryder's name was on the template in the first place was that he is a key member of Roc Nation due to him being co-owner of Roc Nation UK-based subsidiary Takeover Roc Nation record label and entertainment company, the same goes to Stargate (production team) who are the co-owners of the Roc Nation US-based StarRoc record label and publishing company. I would be grateful if you can give an explanation and if bias reverting of WPA edits, which is what this looks like in my oppinion is allowed by Wikipedia as I'm pretty sure it is not. I would like to think this is not a biased issue as I'm sure your a nice person . Thank you.   """,[],0

request for mediation made

hi slim  here's a copy of my initial complaint in case u haven't already seen it by stalking my edits. 

I'm being subject to harassment by two administrators, User:Slimvirgin and User:Jayjg (among other users), who object to my editing and are trying to drive me off the Wikipedia with persistent interference, factitious objections and POV censorship. After trying (and failing) to set me up under 3RR, they are now accusing me of """"disruption"""" and threatening me with a ban because I have objected to their harassment. Among their complaints is that I have been """"uncivil"""". An example of Slim's own standards of civility can be seen on my User talk:Jamaissur: she stalked my editing until she found a chance to make an aggressive and uncivil objection to it, apparently not feeling obliged to follow the same rules as she applies to others.

 The apotropaic powers of inscriptions 

""""Äpotropaic"""" means """"to turn away"""": the idea was that a demon could be turned away from a house etc by displaying a holy text (or at least a magical text) near the door. The inscription therefore had to be clearly visible - at head-level, and outside the door (no point in letting your demon come inside before he could read the magic). The Tel Yayit stone doesn't fulfill these criteria: it was being used in an internal wall, inside a dark room, was about 3 feet off the ground, and was very faint. The archaeologists who found it missed it themselves until the last day of excavation, when they just happened to see it early one morning in ideal conditions, in the low raking light of the rising sun. Tho the setting sun would have done just as well. But the point is, in a dark room 3 feet off the ground, no demon is going to see it or read it, and even if he were a midget-demon, he's already inside, so what's the point? So, no apotropaic powers for this stone.  """,[],0

The Slash Thing again- an idea

I just had an idea about the slash paragraph. I still think it is unnecessary and silly to keep it in but I had an idea that may satisfy everyone. How about we do a paragraph titled """"connection with rock guitarists""""? In the slash paragraph, it's already mentioned that MJ had other guitarists as guests on his records like """"Beat It"""" and """"Dirty Diana""""- how about we keep all that in, change the title of the paragraph and add jennifer Batten and her 3 tours and ten years of work with MJ?

Speedy deletion of Arash fani

I not going to jump to assumptions I am going to ask you directly.

Now I could be completely wrong and I might be viewing you the wrong way and this whole thing maybe be just because I personally believe you have been slightly abusive, especially with reverts of whole edits instead of areas that you personally had an issue with. But then with the lack of you actually communicating with me you can see how one would think these views of you.

 My signature and your actions ~  

I thought about taking this to a dispute hearing, but I couldn't be fucked.  So, I'm just going to outline here why I think that your blocking of my account was unjustified and against policy.  

You stated when you blocked me, """"anon. only, account creation blocked) with an expiry time of indefinite (personal attack in signature - will unblock on signature change"""" .  I disagree with your action on three levels.  The first is that it was a personal attack, the second on the indefinite ban, and the third on any action at all.  

 Why it wasn't a personal attack 
""""The primary purpose of creating any block is to protect Wikipedia and its editors and users from harm."""" (From WP:BP).  Of the list of reasons, on WP:BP the only one plausibly applicable is """"Disruption"""".  Under this it has 

""""A user may be blocked when his/her conduct severely disrupts the project — his/her conduct is inconsistent with a civil, collegial atmosphere and interferes with the process of editors working together harmoniously to create an encyclopedia.""""

And """"Blocks for general incivility are controversial"""".
In no way could any of my actions be considered """"severely"""" disruptive.  Or even simply disruptive.  While it could be argued that my signature was generally uncivil (and I disagree, more later), blocking for this reason is controversial and should have been discussed first.  So, from WP:BP there is no reason (in my opinion) to block.  

Now we examine WP:NPA.  This is simply, """"Do not make personal attacks anywhere in Wikipedia"""" and I agree with it.  The point here is """"personal"""".  My signature was not a personal attack on anyone.  It was a generalised comment and an """"in joke"""" (I can't help it if you are not in on the joke).  For the """"attack"""" to be personal, you would need to find someone who was """"attacked"""", you would not be able to do this.  

So, my signature did not constitute an attack on anyone, it did not disrupt discussion or affect the quality of my edits, thus it should not be a factor in anything.  

As to general incivility, I simply disagree.  From WP:CIVIL, """"Whereas incivility is roughly defined as personally targeted behavior that causes an atmosphere of greater conflict and stress"""".  My signature was not """"personally targeted behavior"""" (as explained above), and I also fail to see how it could cause an atmosphere of """"conflict"""" or """"stress"""".  There is nothing in this policy which is applicable in this case.

 Why I should not have been blocked 
In blocking me indefinitely, you violated WP:BP which states, 

""""Established users with significant constructive edits should not be indefinitely blocked except when there is a community ban. In all other cases, they should be handled with appropriate time-limited blocks or arbitration. Indefinite blocks should not usually be placed on IP users (whether individual IPs or IP ranges) in order to avoid inadvertently blocking legitimate users.""""

In blocking me at all, I also feel that you violated WP:BP.  You did not have a clear reason to block me, and you did so indefinitely.  In these cases, you should have posted at WP:ANI asking for advice and/or detailing why you felt that the block was needed.

 What could have happened 
So, what could you have done?  Well, the simplest thing would have to post on my talk page a comment asking me to change my signature and pointing to the policy which it violated (see the previous case for an example).  If you had have done this (and I had agreed with your argument) then I would have simply changed my signature.  If I had failed to change my signature, then you could have discussed it with me more, and/or taken it to a hearing.   

 Conclusion 
As I said at the beginning, I didn't want to take this to a hearing.  However, I feel that I would be perfectly within my rights to do so, and I reserve the right to do so.  This, by the way, is simply a statement.  

What would I like you to do?  Well, an apology would be nice, perhaps something worded along the lines of """"I'm sorry for not talking to you first, not checking policy and for violating policy by indefinitely blocking you"""".  

If you are unable to give an apology (for whatever reason, say you believe that you were in the right and still are), then I would appreciate a comment regardless.  

A comment on my userpage would be noticed faster, but here would be fine as well.

Fat is never converted to Glc, not at least in humans according to the textbooks.  

Let me add few things. First, Glc enters/leaves the cell through a proces called facilitated diffusion. Which means that as soon as the Glc concentration inside the cell is somehow increased, Glc will start leaving the cell - which by the way happens in hepatocytes during glycogenolysis. Second, even if there was a way to keep Glc inside the cell, say through active transport, Glc poses a danger to the cell integrity as Glc is a highly osmotically active compound. The cell solves these two issues with a single solution by synthesizing glycogen from Glc - the enormous glycogen molecules can't leave the cell, and by having osmotically inert glycogen instead of Glc, the cell avoids the osmotic shock.  13:55, 30",[],0

An event in this article is a March 28 selected anniversary (may be in HTML comment)

From Wikipedia:Village pump:

How many images are too many? I've only ever seen one image. I wanted to add the famous picture of the soldier shot in the head to the Spanish Civil War page, as well as a typical propaganda poster of the times.
 0000 EDT 23 May 2002

IMO, a couple more legal images would be fine.  The article only has 1 image after all.   04:17 23 May 2003 (UTC)

I've recently brought over a lot of new content from the Spanish-language wikipedia. I've done my best to integrate it, but someone may want to take an editorial pass. Also, it seems to me that we ought to have several """"sidebar"""" articles dealing with things like the internal situations in Madrid and Barcelona during the war and there should probably be a lot on Spanish anarchism and the various plitical parties of the time that either exists and should be linked to, or doesn't and should be written.   09:02, 8 Jan 2004 (UTC)

Could someone please explain the communism vs civilization comment in the intro? Thanks. - , 2004-03-14t09:29z
 An atttribution would certainly be nice, and I didn't put it there, but it's certainly on the mark as to how some viewed it. I've seen Hearst Movietone newsreels from the period, and that is pretty much the picture they present. It's also the rhetoric to be found in Franco's speeches during the war. It had very little basis in reality, in my opinion, but leaned heavily on communist atheism and anitclericalism, and the destruction of churches (and  in some cases  torture, murder, etc. of clergy and members of monastic orders) that occurred in the opening weeks of the war. I think the article is accurate in saying that the atrocities in those opening weeks were roughly equal, but the fact that many on the Republican side targeted the Church was endlessly exploited in the Nationalists' rhetoric, and struck a note with conservatives elsewhere who otherwise might have kept more distance from fascism.   17:55, 14 Mar 2004 (UTC)

Pro-Nationalist link
I for one am inclined to keep, for the moment, the recently added Professor Marek Jan Chodakiewicz on The Spanish Civil War. There ought to be at least one external link to a site more sympathetic to the Nationalists than to the Republic. However, I don't think it is a particularly good site: there must be a far more comprehensive presentation of this case (maybe even with some decent footnotes and/or external references itself?) elsewhere on the web. If someone could find a better one and substitute it, I think that would be an improvement.   

 Not Neutral 
I added the note """"The neutrality of this article is disputed."""" because of the insistence in that General Franco or his forces were fascist. This is just communist propaganda. We know better now. Communists wanted to overthrow the legal system of liberties in Spain to create a system similar to that of the Soviet Union. General Franco and his coup prevented that. Of course, the Republican legality was not restored, but that was because it had not proven safe from revolutionary risks. And Monarchy was not restored probably because King Alfonso XIII fled the country only because his partisans lost a municipal ballot, so it appeared to the victors in the war that that king was not reliable to grant individual rights. Of course, Franco's Dictatorship is more than objectionable, but it does not prove that it was a fascist regime.

(this was unsigned, but it's User:Makjavelo

 Frankly, I think this one characterization does not make a non-neutral article. I disagree with much of what Makjavelo has just written, but I do agree with him that the article (or maybe an associated article) might gain from a more extensive explanation of the somewhat complicated relationship of Franco's politics (and Falangism in general) to fascism as such.   17:44, Jun 8, 2004 (UTC)

 This seems like petty apology for Franco, in my opinion. Not only the communists, but the anarchists, socialists and most Republicans refered to the Francoist forces as """"fascist;"""" as well as many historians and authors, e.g. Hemingway. I forget the exact quote, but a Christian clergyman (who were notoriously right-wing at the time, in popular belief) stated that Franco's regime was totalitarian, because he """"controls all aspects of one's life,"""" which can be argued because of the high degree",[],0

I put black in quotes because in the United States """"mulatto"""" and """"black"""" aren't necessarily mutually exclusive concepts.

Interestingly, people at the helm of the """"mulatto movement"""" more than likely turn out to be quadroons or octoroons. It's fascinating because there is a hierarchical paradigm that is followed; and what's funny is that I can imagine hexadecaroon's forming a """"quadroon movement"""" that not only denigrated """"black"""" people but """"mulatto"""" people as well.

Hi, while I agree for the most part with the above statement, I have to take issue with a little bit of the wording, as petty as that may seem.  I believe that stating that the two groups have no """"direct"""" affiliation would be clearer.

Also, the source cited regarding Pakistani support for the Afghan Taliban only alludes to incidents prior to the US invasion of Afghanistan.

I am going to modify the statement slightly to reflect these two points.

 External links on ballet 

Hello! External links are often taken as a """"For further reading"""" section, and as such, should complement the article, adding information we could not. As for ballet terminology, Wikipedia has a Glossary of ballet, and as we are working to create free content, it is more beneficial for us to create a better repository of terms and their meanings than to link to a copyrighted collection. Similarly, we shouldn't be linking to content which we should have, or which is only marginally related (physics of all dance is only marginally related to ballet). However, if you meant to reference a section, there's a different method of going about this documented at Wikipedia:Citing sources. The links used would be contained in a ==References== section, and it'd especially help if you could indicate which facts were verified and which weren't.

It doesn't mean that if a figure also exists in Christianity too that this figure becomes only an article based on the perspective. Isa in his own self can have an article just like Yeahua and Jesu that do exist. It's not simply one perspective of that same person, it's a different belief and the entire reason why the articles is here in the first place. It isn't simply a fact that because a figure exists in two religions that we can not have the real name of the figure being used as the name. It's not something as little as the English language translation, which like I said is not a good argument since we have many articles named on figures in other languages. Just about all the biography articles are that way. a.n.o.n.y.m   t """,[],0
"Mr. Putin is the fairly elected leader of a large nation. He worked hard to bring the Olympic Games to Sochi. He has maintained dialogue with the U.S., not like North Korea. He is not Hitler. I do admit that the analogy was a little bad. His denial that Russian forces are in Ukraine wasn't the best example of a conflict of interest. (Putin says that ethnic Russians in Ukraine are involved, not Russian military forces). A better example might be the governor that recently pardoned his own son.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

BECK: We`re back with Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul, who is joining us tonight for a full hour. I want to make this very clear. I believe that Ron Paul, in general, the group of supporters, some of whom I`ve met while I was on the road, are amazing people. Without any help from the official campaign, Ron Paul supporters have coined the term """"The Ron Paul Revolution."""" They developed the concept for the Guy Fawkes Day money bomb back on November 5th which raised over $4 million. They hired a blimp to fly over New Hampshire to promote the Ron Paul campaign. Last Sunday, they held a tea party, where they broke John Kerry`s single day primary fundraising record by collecting another $6 million. But the downside is, when you have rabid supporters, some of them believe they can speak to their own agendas using the candidate`s name. And I just in the break showed Dr. Paul just a clip, a very small part of a five- minute video that is on the Internet where I am named a traitor and traitors should be executed.

British National Party (under Nick Griffin has modernised from white nationalism to a more moderate """"ethno-nationalism"""" supporting British indigenism).Under Nick Griffin the British National Party espouses """"ethno-nationalism"""" based on """"concern for the well-being of the English, Scottish, Welsh and Irish ethnic nations that compose the United Kingdom"""" (see Indigenism). The BNP Language & Concepts Discipline Manual (BNP Policy Research, updated April 2009) states that the British National Party is """"ethno-nationalist"""" and not a racial white nationalist party. The main BNP website also proclaims that their ideology is ethnic nationalism, as do many articles posted on their website.  This distinction between racial and ethnic nationalism is also clarified in Folk and Nation: Underpinning the Ethnostate a 26 page booklet by Nick Griffin and Arthur Kemp (Ostara Publications; 2nd ed., 2009). The work contains the following chapters which concern the ethnic nationalist (as opposed to racial) stance of the party: """"Ethnic Nationalism - A Definition; Central Tenets of Ethno-Nationalism; Underlying Concepts of Ethno-Nationalism; The Implications of Ethno-Nationalism; The Practical Application of Ethno-Nationalism; Attacks on Ethno-Nationalism; and How to Argue the Case for Ethno-Nationalism"""". However before Nick Griffin modernised the party to ethnic nationalism, the BNP were explicitly racial white nationalists Goodbye, racial nationalism, hello, ethno-nationalism. Mainstream newspapers such as The Guardian in Britain have also noted of the BNP's change under Griffin from racial nationalism to ethnic nationalism.The Guardian, Friday 22 December 2006 The modern British National Party under Nick Griffin however reject racial nationalism, and strongly oppose immigration from whites (such as Eastern Europeans) to Britain (Global encyclopaedia of political geography, M.

None of the changes I made violates any Wiki policy, and you're the only one to ever dispute any of those changes I made, which tells me you were just looking to pick fights more than trying to be a defender of all things Wiki.  And while I was in the wrong for going overboard with threats, make no mistake...I don't like you, and will never like you.  There is no consensus between us, because your idea of consensus is brow beating me until I give up.  And give me one good reason why I should let the SPI go...you did me wrong...why should I allow people to do me wrong without some sort of repercussion?  You seem to want a one sided relationship with me on Wikipedia...give you everything while I get the finger - doesn't work that way.  You want me to drop the SPI, you drop the Gomer Pyle """"Citizen's Arrest"""" act every time I make an edit.  As I said, the only one to ever take issue with those edits on those pages is you, which is why I honestly believe you just look to pick fights.  Just as an experiment, leave those pages the way I have them for the rest of the month...if someone else has an issue with them, then I'll change it.  If not, than I'll know it was just you looking to pick a fight.

WP:MilHist Assessment
An excellent excellent start. There's an infobox, pictures and maps, and extensive details. I wonder if there is anything more to be added on such an incredibly famous battle? In addition, just a few minor stylistic improvements - (1) the introduction does not state, or even imply, the incredible fame and importance of this battle. If I came across this article, somehow having never heard of Salamis, I'd read the intro and think """"oh, this is just another one of those battles from those Greek wars that I never understood anything about"""", and I'd move on. As it stands now, you have to scroll all the way to the bottom in order to see anything about the importance and fame of the battle. (2) I wonder if there is any better way to organize the listing of the numbers of ships. Obviously, regular paragraph form will look quite confusing and ugly, and a table would likely take up just as much space as the list... can anything be done here? Maybe a table with multiple columns? Otherwise, a very nice article for a very major topic.

Trouble is there is no consistency in trademark usage, old documents, WP:MOS vs. WP:MOSTM, English grammar, or editor ideas that prevails with capitals or not. My concept appears to prevail in a few dozen articlesI have read. The issue has never been resolved due to behavioural issues induced into every discussion and a lack of Arbitated Policy continues the randon edits. Even it my mentioned method succeeds think of the rogue editor seeing this, """"When all the Beatles played together The Beatles made good music."""" I am only concerned with the unaddressed behaviour of this and a few other editors in these discussions. Nobody seems to want to take them on. Some agreed that a """"shot across the bow"""" may be in order. Funny thing; all of the editors agree an arbitrated decision is needed but won't muzzle themselves long enough to draw serious attention.

"""This is a good article on J.A. Wheeler.However, the information regarding geometrodynamics is not accurate, especially the following statement: """"Wheeler abandoned it as fruitless in the 1970s"""".As a matter of fact, Wheeler kept using the term """"geometrodynamics"""" to describe Einstein's theory of general relativity till his last days. For example, in Gravitation and Inertia, a book written with the Italian physicist I.Ciufolini in 1995(and which was missing from the bibliography), the authors keep referring to """"Einstein Geometrodynamics""""(the title of Chapter 2) throughout the the book: Chapter 3 is entitled """" Tests ofEinstein Geometrodynamics"""", Chapter 5 is """"The Initial-Value Problem in Einstein Geometrodynamics"""" and Chapter 7:""""Some Highlights of the past and a Summary of Geometrodynamics and Inertia"""".This proves that Wheeler did not abandon the concept at all in the 1970s!

Even with the new information about whether SJP has an apostrophe or an extra s, the only way the 'dab page for similar names' idea makes any sense, is if you make every similar name without a target:

 St. James Park
 St James' Park
 St. James' Park
 St James's Park
 Saint James Park
 Saint James' Park
 Saint James's Park

all point to the 'home dab page', St James Park, with outgoing links to the articles:

 St. James's Park (the primary topic, the london park)
 St James' Park, Newcastle
 St James' Park, Bristol (article setion pipe link)
 St James Park, Exeter

I still think this is pretty poor solution, when there are no direct conflicts between the actual article names used. I frankly don't see how it is any better than when the articles had dab hats to cater for people who either mispelled links or mis-spelled in the search box. The only advantage to adding (, Newcastle) to the title is for pre-emptive assistance to user navigation in the search box, so in that case, a redirect variation for London, Newcastle, Exeter needs to be created for all similar names that a user might type into the search box, namely:

 St James Park
 St. James Park
 St James' Park
 St. James' Park
 St James's Park 
 St. James's Park
 Saint James Park
 Saint James' Park

meaning that:

 St James Park, Newcastle
 St. James Park, Newcastle
 St James' Park, Newcastle
 St. James' Park, Newcastle
 St James's Park, Newcastle
 St. James's Park, Newcastle
 Saint James Park, Newcastle
 Saint James' Park, Newcastle
 Saint James's Park, Newcastle

should all redirect to St James' Park, Newcastle as the current name

I will do that now as it seems a good idea anyway, whether this article stays with """" ,Newcastle"""" added to the title or not.

CBDunkerson,
I hope this comment on my own talk page is not considered intervention. (I see I've been unblocked.)

I did not mean to suggest that MONGO was purposely inserting information as part of his job. The only reason I said """"I would not be surprised"""", is because this has been going on for a while now and Wikipedia has not stopped it. What else am I to think? (Although I admit to not being familiar with Wikipedia's procedures.) Still, that comment by me is nothing compared to what MONGO's been getting away with.

(Also just noticed this btw.)

Wikipedia is supposed to be NPOV which is why MONGO should steer clear of the 9/11 pages.

An examination of the exchanges between MONGO and myself here is a good example:

MONGO seems content with personal attacks: """"who cares how many misguided folks there are"""".

His comments are clearly ad hominem personal attacks towards me, and many others.

The following, from this page, shows he's content with namecalling as well. I removed an external link to a namecalling site, MONGO reverts me leaving the following statement: I like this weblink...it summaries things quite well

I apologize for any insinuations on my part, but also must stress my own attempts at a NPOV.

I'm sure we all agree, from MONGO's own statements here that he is neither apologetic nor neutral:

""""The POV pushers that try to add nonsense to the articles related to the 9/11 events have been told repeatedly that the vast majority of their """"contributions"""" to those article violated numerous policies. This doesn't seem to stop them. This editor I blocked routinely reverts those that support the concensus verison and yes, conspiracy theorists is what they are...they are not researchers.

Speedy deletion of WiSens(R), a portfolio of IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee products such as protocol analyzer, commissioner, network manager etc.,
 A tag has been placed on WiSens(R), a portfolio of IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee products such as protocol analyzer, commissioner, network manager etc., requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a company or corporation, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for companies and corporations. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

Hello James Cantor,

Thank you so much for your comments. The last 21 Nobel Laureates in Physiology or Medicine have had wiki pages for a number of years and the wiki community has added as much information as is fitting a Nobel Laureate.

I can not but wonder how Wim Crusio's page is so much bigger than that last 21 of the most recent Nobel Laureates in Physiology or Medicine. As a scientist, one tends to plot data on a graph, and if you where to do so, Crusio's data point would be considered an out lier. As I stated, the wiki community has added as much information as is fitting a Nobel Laureate over many years. These pages have been edited by hundreds of users for many years, I think that gives us good yard stick, and says something about how much information a scientists site should have.

"Introduction & the article 

Hi new poster here, ive been following the article for a few weeks, I have reviewed the external links good and bad and have a few ideas.  The controversy that surrounds this organization seems to be based between nichiren shoshu(in japan) and sgi(international) with alot of the groundwork coming from japan where the organizations originated from.  After looking around and comparing to the other religions and sects, i propose we seperate the criticisms from each article and make a new article that, most likely, will be a cite war.  
  The benefit is two-fold.  First, the articles relating to each sect of buddhism talk about THAT buddhism, what they do, where they came from, etc etc, and not talk about the criticisms that anyone may have about them(similar to the anti-christianity criticism article and others).  This is the most NPOV solution i can up with.  Also, having a criticisms oriented paragraph in the intoduction seems extremely bias against an organization that promotes culture and peace(i have seen some demonstrations, nothing on a global scale or read about the political party, has anyone btw?)

"Disruptive edits 

Hello, . Despite 's statement, you have not so far been reported at WP:Administrator intervention against vandalism as far as I can see; but if you continue your disruptive editing you will be. Looking at your edits, I get that you have strong opinions about John de Ruiter. While I know nothing of him, I have some sympathy with your position. But you are going about your campaign in a way that is disruptive to Wikipedia, and you need to stop.
First, as you have already been told, you introduced material (and, in particular, critical material) into a biography of a living person without giving any references to a published source which supports your material. This is absolutely forbidden, but the first time you did it our policy of assuming good faith should lead any other editor to just remove your additions and explain to you that this is not acceptable; and this is what happened.
What you are encouraged to do at that point, is to discuss the matter on the talk page Talk:John de Ruiter, and try to reach agreement with other editors; if you are unable to do so, our dispute resolution procedure would tell you how to proceed.
What you did do, is to insert your unsupported material again. This is called edit warring, and is a quick way to get yourself blocked from Wikipedia.

Assuming that you are in good faith (i.e. that you think the de Ruiter article is unbalanced), your best bet is to start by finding some reliable published sources which are critical of him (not blogs or forums, but material from reputable publishers). If you can find some, then you may edit the article to add only what is supported by the sources you have found (though in view of your recent history, even in this case you should probably start by discussing it on the talk page). If you cannot find such sources, then I'm afraid you must not edit the page further. Unsupported material and original research are not permitted in Wikipedia articles.

I suspect that you believe that it is important to expose something you think is not right about how de Ruiter presents himself. If that is that case, I'm afraid that Wikipedia is not a soapbox, and you may not use it in that way.",[],0

Appealing is without purpose. It is my observation that you do not follow the rules of Wikipedia, so pointing out to you anything wrong in your action, wrongful by Wikipedia rules, is meaningless. 

When the majority do not see any problem with requiring some people to sit in the back of the bus, it ain't going to change by pointing out their actions to them. I live with racism every day; but pointing out to someone on Wikipedia how their actions are akin to the majority imposing its will upon the minority, and refusing to explain their actions, that is, to give some facts behind the conclusory rhetoric of those refusing to allow any edit on the topic at hand, or even answer the question with some mention of what part of a long rule they are talking about (as Chowbok asked), then I've been uncivil and the metaphor is offensive.

"And 

Paganism

Southgate, who has a degree in theology and religious studies from Canterbury University, rejected Catholicism and moved towards neo-pagan and heathen groups that are ‘very loyal to the Gods of the Northern Tradition’, including the Odinic Rite, the Tribe of the Wulfings and the A ´ satru´ Alliance, a pagan movement concerned with practising rituals and magic and led by Valguard (Mike) Murray, a former member of the American Nazi Party.91 Further evidence of this transition from Catholicism to paganism emerged in an interview with Wotan, the organ of the Charlemagne Hammer Skins.92 Southgate believed that Wotan’s celebration of the heroes of the Norse pantheon represented ‘the most genuine expression of European spirituality, culture and identity’.93 Another key expression of this ‘identity’ is exhibited by Southgate’s interest in the militaristic cult of Mithras and the ‘pagan spirituality’ of the apostate Roman emperor Julian II.94

This rejection of Christianity has an avowedly antisemitic dimension. Through the figure of Christ, Christianity has Judaic roots and is therefore irredeemably tainted; only the ‘weak’ continue to worship a ‘dead Jew’.95 The emphasis on the Judaic roots of Christianity, however, is regarded as of secondary importance to its usurpation of the rituals, sacraments and hierarchy of the ancient pagan solar religion Mithras, which was introduced into Iran and India by marauding Aryan tribes from the Russian steppes between BCE 2000 and 1500 before spreading to the Roman empire. Although it failed to defeat early Christianity in the battle for religious supremacy during the fourth century, Mithras continues to be viewed by esoteric thinkers (including Evola and Jung) as an alternative path the West could have followed. It retains its appeal as an initiatory cult or aristocratic order akin to the Knights Templar or, latterly, Himmler’s SS which, the NRF claims, had its origins in various ‘Anarchist droite ’ circles l e the Black Sun and the Thule Society. While Christianity tried to neuter this vital expression of the ‘Aryan psyche’, the awareness of Europe’s ‘Faustian’ destiny is currently enjoying a renaissance within the occult milieu. These ideas were also absorbed by thinkers like Evola and Rene´ Gue´non who discerned in them the fragments of a ‘hidden albeit distinct and fundamental truth’.96 For Southgate, as for Evola, Tradition is an ‘an underlying current which both permeates and transcends all’.97

Southgate’s discovery of Evolian ‘Primordial Tradition’ and his consequent rejection of Catholicism as ‘the sole cosmological truth’ ran in tandem with his immersion in the industrial music scene.98 This ‘cultural vanguard’ is spearheaded by a number of Gothic-Industrial, Dark Ambient, Black and ‘Viking’ Metal bands, including Allerseelen, Blood Axis, Burzum, Current 93, Dark Holler, Death in June, Endura, Mayhem, Ostara, Puissance and Sol Invictus, though it also encompasses more commercial bands like Cradle of Filth.99 Although it would be an exaggeration to say that these groups conform to a defined political agenda, their music serves to diffuse the ideals of Mithraic paganism and Nordic folk myths within this youthful underground subculture far more effectively than any number of meetings and marches could, thus providing the ‘perfect antidote’ to the spiritually enervating, multiracial values of a globalizing ‘system’. Southgate has also noted the potential of the Straight Edge punk movement and its hard core of puritanically intolerant followers, an interesting development given (exaggerated) reports of an emerging ‘anti-anti-establishment’ pro-Bush right-wing punk movement.100 Although Southgate realizes that the groupuscular right cannot control music-orientated youth cultures, he believes a minority can be induced ‘to take a direction basically conducive to our aims’.101 Southgate seeks to do this through his online magazine Synthesis, which features a music section replete with interviews and gig reviews.102

This is not simply cynical manipulation. Southgate appears genuinely interested in the counter culture he seeks to target. His fanzine, Tribal Resonance, ‘the voice of the racial avant-garde’, reveals Southgate’s strategy of linking his ideas to ‘the common language and the big ideas of our culture’.103 Through the medium of musical subcultures and the creation of alternatives ‘from without’, Southgate hopes to permeate existing political subcultures transversally, as the Nazis did, through a process of ‘cultural osmosis’ that aims to recode the ‘social symbology’ of the host culture so that its ideas can metastasize throughout the body politic, recalibrating its genetic inheritance. By creating ‘cultural hegemony’ the groupuscular right believes it can forge the ‘political space’ necessary for political and racial hegemony.104

As about the Google search, I have been told about references to Z++, mostly in European forums etc. In some cases that I became interested, I had to use a translator (I was shown how to do that) so I could see what was being said about Z++. Unlike you, those folks had looked at the Z++ syntax chart and were discussing its features.
About the use of .h and namespace, your are making a big guess about Z++ without first trying to understand what Z++ is. You are wrong in guessing that Z++ is an extension of C++, the way C++ extends C by porting Simula classes. No, there is no chance of confusing Z++ files with C header files. The notion of namespace is quite extensive in Z++. Please read more carefully before commenting.
You are wrong in guessing that Z++ is in competition with C++. It is not, nor I care what C++ can or cannot do. However, in order to provide a perspective for illustrating ideas, one has to make references to other known implementations. C++ is such a minimal subset of Z++ that I can simply use C, Simula, ADA, Eiffel and APL in order to provide context for understanding the contributions of Z++ to software development. But then, C++ includes C and Simula, and is known to many.
Mr. Best, had your request for deletion not followed our discussion in the Google's C++ newsgroup, I would have assumed that you are sincere, and would have tried to clarify any confusion. You are simply doing this, and improperly using my last name for what happened there. Please indicate some inconsistency within Z++ language, or explain how you think Z++ is in competition with C++, rather than expressing your dislike.

 Articles for creation/Miriam Battista 

Hi Arctic Kangaroo,

I'm totally puzzled by the reasons you gave for rejecting this article Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation:/Miriam Battista. Miriam Battista is definitely """" 'worthy of notice' – that is, 'significant, interesting, or unusual enough to deserve attention or to be recorded'."""" It's true that her moment of national fame was short, but it was intense, and she continued to be noticed in the press as an adult actress. Also, the fact that she received a news obit (not paid for by the family) in the New York Times should in itself attest to her notability, since the obit was published so many years after her heyday. For comparison, please look at the article for Gladys Hulette. I certainly think that Battista rises to at least the same level of notability.

As far as verifiable references are concerned, I truly thought I had over-referenced if anything! There are references to Charles Donald Fox's book Famous Film Folk, Photoplay, Variety, The New Yorker, the New York Times, the Internet Broadway Database, and Internet Movie Database - are these not considered reliable, verifiable sources? If the problem is that I used too many references to privately held materials, I apologize for that, but I thought that the information they included was interesting and enlightening. I guess that raises a basic question for me: would Wikipedia prefer that information from privately held materials be omitted, even if it sheds light on the subject? If the answer is """"Yes,"""" I'm afraid that Wikipedia is missing out on a gold mine of material.

Ah, yes, but we probably need a quotation from another view that conflicts it. Would anyone be able to find one? |heru|nar 

Some comments regarding France's utter defeat in the Napoleonic Wars should be part of the article, nonetheless. The fact that France slipped from being the top European power to a secondary level, clearly below Britain's and soon also below Germany's and even Austria's, is hardly contentious. It must be remembered that the Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars came hard on the heels of what appeared to Europe's intellectuals as Britain's final, unavoiding loss of great power status, following the independence of the U.S. (just six years before the assault on the Bastille)  
Actually France was the dominate continental power until the Franco-Prussian war and remains a great power to this day.  

 I must respectfully disagree with this latest assertion, since France was smaller in size and less influential than both Austria and Russia before the Prussian war. Even if one were to concede that it was the main """"continental"""" power, that would imply a loss of status - before the Napoleonic Wars, it was the main European power, including Britain, and had beaten combined enemy armies time and time again. As for keeping great power status to this day, I'm sure that that should come as great surprise to the French, humiliated by Nazi occupation and resolutely defeated both in Vietnam and Algeria. Now, it's true they can veto stuff in the UN - just like the (then) underdeveloped island of Taiwan did until 1973, for whatever that's worth. 
Aussiesta who cares about your stupid POV? you are telling nonsense. nazi humiliation etc, pff. weren't the US humiliated in vietnam, in cuba and now in iraq? so they aren't great anymore then right? didn't the soviet retreated from afghanistan? what about them? the german were defeated and occupied in 1918 and 1945 what about them? what about the old good british? they were wiped by the germans in the campaigns of 1939 (Norway) then 1940 (France) and Dunkirk, a defeat transformed into a great victory, what a joke! actually in indochina and algeria the french had 10 times less casualties than their opponents, is this a defeat? a defeat is supposed to happen when one is loosing a war not when he is winning it. these two decolonization wars were wasted by politics. the very same happened in the overlooked Suez Crisis of 1956. the british surrendered there. they left their french and israeli """"allies"""" without warning. ever heard about the Madagasacar war of independence? no? why? because france smashed the rebellion in a such violent way there are ashamed of. no one knows what happened in madagascar in 1946 so it is not in history books. moreover france is still a great power with remaining overseas territories and a strong nuclear force (the third one in terms of warheads after russia and usa) your beloved austrian and german doesn't have. so watch your tongue. quoting a non neutral POV is just the same as giving your own opinion. who do you think you can fool with your francophobic tricks?

In a furnished apartment for rent you can have a separate living room, bedroom, kitchen, office space etc. so that the traveler can have a comfortable staying experience and doesn’t feel homesick.

Temporary Corporate Housing
Nowadays, there has been a large increase of temporary relocation of employees. To be away on an unfamiliar place on a business trip is not so easy as it seems to be. As you overcome all the professional challenges, you also have an emotional challenge to overcome while deciding to stay away from home for a longer period. Thus, you need a temporary accommodation which is as comfortable as possible. Staying in a hotel for more than few days can be very expensive for corporates. So, most of the business executives during their visits to different cities or different countries prefer to stay in a short term corporate housing as it is economical as well as beneficial from accommodation point of view. The main aspect in travelling is the accommodation. If the accommodation is good, you will feel comfortable and happy and will be able to achieve your professional goals easily. Short term corporate housing consists of furnished apartments, condominiums, and homes that provide short term accommodations for business executives and people who want to stay on a temporary basis. So, whenever you are going for any business trip or for mini vacation then short term corporate housing rentals is the best option for enjoying the trip.

 Using Joan Roth as a source for Bukharan history

If someone wants to use her as a history source, email her (I'd do it myself, but I don't have time presently) at JoanLRoth@aol.com, and ask her for her sources for her assertion.

"In light of Ted Cruz hearings and the evidence of warming adjustments, to Change the global temperature graph to RSS 

In the Congressional meeting yesterday evidence was presented showing massive warming adjustments to surface data so that the whole 1940 to present warming could be explained by these warming adjustments alone. In sharp contrast, the global satellite temperature was stated by the majority of scientists to be the most credible scientifically. Moreover it is corroborated by the Meteorological balloon data. And independent evidence from growing Antarctic ice, that this year global sea ice is back to normal and even Greenland surface ice is growing strongly suggests that there is no current warming and that the surface data is corrupted either by these warming adjustments or by urban heating. Moreover the satellites are far more global than the surface data - and the increasing ice shows the areas they miss at the poles are not melting.

I would therefore propose that the present graph utilising the less scientifically valid surface data which is in no sense global nor accurate given the massive and judgemental adjustments should be removed and replaced with either UAH or RSS.",[],0

Endurance
Q: """"Thank you for the welcome and tips! I would like to move some of the stuff on the Endurance and the Expedition out of the Shackleton article, since their scope is really quite a bit larger than him - can I do this? Is there any special way? """"

A: Absolutely yes!  It's pretty easy....just pick a concise and appropriate name for a new article on the expedition and start to build new content there.  You get started by putting the new article title in the search box.  If it's available you'll get offered a link to start a new article with that name.

I suggest putting some comments on the discussion page of your new article describing what you are trying to accomplish (same thing goes for the Shackleton article).  That way, other editors won't misunderstand what's going on.   If the new article is going to be under construction for awhile, it's a good idea to put a """"stub"""" notice at the bottom of it so folks know that there is more to come.  You add a stub notice by putting this at the bottom of the page: {{stub}}

As the new article takes shape and adds breadth and depth that the parent article lacks, you may find you need to tinker with the parent article to ensure that there is the right amount of detail there...not too much and not too little.  

Lastly, you'll want to find out what other articles exist that should link to your new article and add links on them.  That requires a bit of searching and digging around but usually isn't a problem and helps integrate your article into the broader encyclopedia.

Good luck with your article!  If you need any help, don't hesitate to ask.

 Traditional or Simplified Chinese? 

I've moved this to a new section because it has become difficult to continue two topics in the same section. I would like to discuss what should be done about the issue of Traditional and Simplified Chinese in TW related articles (without discussing romanisation methods). My aim is just to get a consensus (either way), and not simply to push my ideas on wiki. I have tried posting similar topics in the HK page as well as the manual of style, but it seems hard to have an active discussion let alone get any real consensus. 

Why are we still including both sets in these articles?

Naturally I support removing simplified Chinese from TW related articles. It is just as misleading to include traditional chinese in the PRC article as it is to include simplified chinese in the ROC article. I am not talking about matters of race or cultural identity, but about de facto usage. Users in the pinyin section have argued (quite well) that hanyu pinyin should be included in ROC articles because it is used de facto, even in TW. So why then can't we eliminate simplified chinese from the TW related articles as TW's de facto standard is traditional chinese only? Wiki is not a chinese dictionary, so is there any reason to include TW and PRC's writing systems in the articles of the other? This doesn't have anything to do with anyone's personal views on """"one china"""" or """"two chinas"""", but rather is an issue of reflecting the language situation in both areas and cleaning up articles.

"""I had nearly moved on when I felt completely compelled to comment on this statement """"probably better than most clan websites, which tend to be based on long outdated stuff from the 19th century. Then I do not see a problem in using it until a better source can be found. Especially to make amends to the masses of unsourced information that is found on so many of the individual clan articles"""". I can only interpet this as something is probably better because it is newer?? This makes no sense to me. History is what it is, it should not change for the sake of change. If it was accurate over 600 years ago, it is just as accurate today. Again, if something is true and accurate hundreds or even thousands of years ago, it is not and should not be subject to change because someone decides to re-write it for either personal gain or an agenda. That is exactly what has happened with the origins for many Highland Clans. For any that might be interested, William Skene's and John Murray's collaboration of The Highlanders of Scotland: Their Origin, History and Antiquities is a wonderful and refreshing read. This is more than likely the truest accounting for several of the Highland Clans. It asserts that many of the origin claims put forth in more recent times are attempts to gain a foothold on the Chieftainship, by usurping the rightful lines. You'll find that cadet septs used this technique to basically try to re-write history for their own selfish gain. You'd have to read the book to see how this played out but as I said before, nearly ALL of the Highland Clans being """"bastardized"""" as Norman/Anglo-Horman/Flemish, etc. are really Dalriadan and Pictish mixes. Examples would be Campbell, Cameron, Grant, Davidson, Wallace, etc. I of course have distant YDNA connections to ALL of these surnames, but I know no one wants to hear about that as any sort of evidence. I'll admit not one of these surnames or clans has a pure lineage, but they all have a lineage going back to the Picts and Gaels. I am of that lineage, which is quite rare and continues to be established. The masses are not of that lineage, they are a mix if R1A1, other R1B haplotypes, the I haplotypes, etc. I will be the first to admit there may be hundreds of families, not even related through a shared male ancestor, sharing a surname or Clan. My concern is with the origins only, and the original Chiefly lines. And please don't tell me how we are a mix of so much dna, I am only referring to YDNA, the male lines. I am not talking about MTDNA nor Autosomal. What I don't understand is why when there is so much sourced information out there, some editors choose only to use factually inaccurate """"sourced"""" information. There is substantial """"factually accurate"""" sourced information out there however it is not my intent, to correct these erroneous articles or to present an """"opposing view"""". There is no opposing view, there is either the truth, or their are lies. Either the Celtic version is correct, or the Comyn version is correct, or neither is correct. There can't factually be multiple versions of an origin, it is what it is and there is only one true origin. This is not a contest to see who can provide more recent sources. I would hope wikipedia would want the truth out there, and not contests of who can out edit who, which is what wikipedia appears to be. There, my case is presented to the message and not a specific messenger. Clan Davidson is Celtic, it descended from Celts and it has no connection to the Comyn family. It did not descend from a Comyn male. They came from a very ancient Gaelic ancestor, an ancestor shared by several Highland Clans, before surnames even were in use. One other greatly incorrect update to this site was the battle alleged between the Davidson's and the MacPherson's....this never happened. The battle was between the Clans fighting for the Chief of the Clan Chattan, the battle was fought between the Mackintoshs and the MacPhersons.The MacPhersons were the true chiefly line, but were """"out-documented"""" by the usurping Mackintosh. This is pretty much exactly what is happening here, on this very page. I hope someone else has more time and energy to properly update this page with the correct information and let's bury the lies and factually inaccurate information comprising most of this article. It was originally much more factually accurate, but over the course of time has been corrupted with sourced information that is not also factually accurate.

 Advice on Portal:Jurassic Park: 

Hi Firs. I recently found the mentioned portal after it was placed in the related portals section of the dino portal. I checked it out & saw it had a number of problems which were in violation of the fair use policy among others. Firstly, none of the pictures on the portal (all of which are fair use) have fair use rationale. I expressed this to the user (User:Cuddly Panda) who has been the sole contributor of the portal with no reply. On closer inspection, it seems the user has been uploading & adding fair use images to wikipedia for some time now, possibly upwards of a year, & despite numerous warning from automated bots etc, has now seemed to learn from this or the links provided or ceased their image infringements. Just check out the user's talk page - nearly every message is a message about the misuse of uploads. In addition to this, the portal is very poor in quality, unmaintained and relies heavily on unfree images and poor portal sections (some of which have already been nominated for deletion). So I wanted to ask you what action I could take next. There's a few options:

1) Obviously the user is not listening to warnings & my messages, so could I possibly bring this up at the administrator's noticeboard? They could then decide what to do next.
2) Since sections of the JP Portal are being nomianted for deletion already, I could potentially nominate the whole portal at MfD with a vote of """"no opinion"""". This would see what other editors think of the portal & even if it is kept, the portal's fair use pictures problem would still be sorted out by the end of the nomiantion.
3) I'll probably do this anyway, but the user is on Editor Review & I could also place a note there explaining what the user is doing wrong & how to remedy this.

So, I'd personally like to do all three, but if you can think of something else & help me decide which of those, if any, to carry out, it would be appreciated. I'll post this to another admin just to get a second opinion as well. Cheers,  """,[],0

 Final Fantasy (video game)

As the article is essentially about the original game, it's pretty much assumed that the gameplay and plot sections refers to the NES version's gameplay.

There are several parentheses throughout the plot section that confuse me. Example: """"Lefeinish (Lufenian)"""". I think it refers to the original name, and to the name used in later versions in parenthesis, but I'm not sure.

The above statements about the essences of Nichiren Buddhism are which sects did what is a partial explanation; it is clear that it was composed respectfully by someone sympathetic to a particular sect, SGI.  SGI has a powerful voice around and world and has historically represented Nichiren Buddhism to important world leaders who sought it's understanding.  There are at least 2 other schools of Nichiren Buddhism: Nichiren Shu and Nichiren ShoShu.  These sects warn of SGI (but do not prohibit) it's practice; many feel that SGI inherently contains certain personality-cult rituals, and too frequently worship President Ikeda (the current leader of SGI) along with Nichiren and Shakyamuni Buddha.  Nichiren himself has said that he was not a Buddha, but an incarnation of Jogyo Bodhisattva.  The path of the Lotus Sutra is the path of the Bodhisattva  one who delays their own enlightenment until all other sentient beings in the universe have been saved from suffering.  Schools like Nichiren Shu do not believe that the priest should not be worshiped, nor the president, only the Dharma, the Wonderful Flower of the Lotus Teaching.  Several western nations have placed SGI on their respective """"Cult watch"""" lists, and in extreme cases family members have written letters to their governments for assistance in getting their relative de-brainwashed.

 Nothing personal 

Greetings Elitra, I just wanted to let you know my comments are nothing personal towards you or the other WMF folks but the release of VE with so many problems is premature and folks have a valid point that proper notification wasn't given. Please don't take the following as a negative reflection but I wanted to clarify a couple things. People are frustrated because now, as in the past, it seems as thought the WMF doesn't listen to what us editors are saying. Yes you have evidence that you tried to notify users but the way the notifications were done and the places they were located gives the impression that the folks building these changes don't understand the community or how it works. You are also worknig hard to fix the problems but then releae the app to all logged in users knowing there are a lot of problems, many of which are severe. Then you act as though your surprised and hurt that we are annoyed. We know you are working on the problems, but so are we and we want to feel as though our voices are heard too. When the Visual Editor talk pages aren't filled with long lists of complaints and bugs, then we can talk about a widescale release. But there's no need to rush it out yet. Anyway, I just wanted to clarify that the problems aren't with you, they are with the WMF organizations's ongoing policy of doing whatever they feel like regardless of what us dumb editors think. Happy editing. PS, sorry they mixed us up.  

 Your user page 

Hi Elitre, when we designed the  template, we intended to make it easy for staff to use it and edit it, so added parameters that would make it easy to update the relevant sections. I noticed that you'd substituted the template on your user page instead of transcluding it and presumed this was not intentional, so I've gone ahead and boldly switched it to the template, making a few general fixes. This should allow you to also edit your user page through the Visual Editor. Please feel free to undo my changes if you intended to substitute the template! -) helpfulone 

 Random act of kindness 

 Hello Elitre (WMF), Eduemoni has given you a shining smiling star! You see, these things promote WikiLove and hopefully this has made your day better. Spread the  whether it be someone you have had disagreements with in the past or someone putting up with some stick at this time. Enjoy! ↑talk↓

 DVD Release 

Regarding this section of the article:  """"This release is notable because, due to marketing issues, it was the first Star Wars film never to be released on VHS in the United States.""""  I think that this can be eliminated.  First of all, this doesn't really make the release notable.  Most films released at the same time were not released on VHS.  Also, the fact that it WAS released on VHS in other countries makes it even less notable.  It also does not have anything to do with the """"DVD"""" release, but rather the """"home video"""" release.  """,[],0

"Who is minding the minder?  Climategate and Wikipedia  
http://blogs.news.com.au/heraldsun/andrewbolt/index.php/heraldsun/comments/climategate_how_the_cabal_controlled_wikipedia

One person in the nine-member Realclimate.org team — U.K. scientist and Green Party activist William Connolley — would take on particularly crucial duties.

Connolley took control of all things climate in the most used information source the world has ever known – Wikipedia. Starting in February 2003, ... Connolley set to work on the Wikipedia site. He rewrote Wikipedia’s articles on global warming, on the greenhouse effect, on the instrumental temperature record, on the urban heat island, on climate models, on global cooling. On Feb. 14, he began to erase the Little Ice Age; on Aug.11, the Medieval Warm Period. In October, he turned his attention to the hockey stick graph. He rewrote articles on the politics of global warming and on the scientists who were skeptical of the band. Richard Lindzen and Fred Singer, two of the world’s most distinguished climate scientists, were among his early targets, followed by others that the band especially hated, such as Willie Soon and Sallie Baliunas of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, authorities on the Medieval Warm Period.

All told, Connolley created or rewrote 5,428 unique Wikipedia articles. His control over Wikipedia was greater still, however, through the role he obtained at Wikipedia as a website administrator, which allowed him to act with virtual impunity. When Connolley didn’t like the subject of a certain article, he removed it — more than 500 articles of various descriptions disappeared at his hand. When he disapproved of the arguments that others were making, he often had them barred — over 2,000 Wikipedia contributors who ran afoul of him found themselves blocked from making further contributions… In these ways, Connolley turned Wikipedia into the missionary wing of the global warming movement.

Book VI Reproduction of birds, fish and quadrupeds.

This way one would not have to write a book report on the whole thing and could focus on why he classified these animals in a certain way and how others would later be influenced by his system of catagorization.

""":::::::Dictatorship of the status quo?!

Looking through the archives here, it seems that discussion of the article's name has almost entirely revolved around a suggested move to """"British India"""".  Clearly such a move would be outright wrong.  But that still leaves us with the problem that while """"British Raj"""" does seem to get usage as a name for the territories under the authority of the Governor-General in Council, it's also used as the name for a period (see the article lede at """"History of the British Raj"""" by way of example).  In other words, the term is ambiguous, and thus we keep having people here and elsewhere changing terms back and forth, and I don't see how that will change so long as that ambiguity remains.  That's why I think """"Indian Empire"""" is better; it's clearly about a country.  Alternatively, and I say this through slightly gritted teeth, we could have it at """"British Indian Empire"""".

As for usage by historians, surely they most commonly use the simple term """"India""""?  Which is not of course to say that other terms don't get used (especially in book titles).

NPOV concerns

I tend to agree with the NPOV concerns of some comments here.  They seem to be more along the lines of what is *not* included than what is.  To be fair, a google search returned far more of the 'critical' sources than any other.

However, I was able to make a minor edit I regard as an improvement. I replaced one Guardian article, """"Iran contra men return to power"""" with another from the same publication, the """"Negroponte: Amercia's voice of experience"""" article.

I believe the former article is redundant to many of the others, and as the least specific to Mr. Negroponte is the least relevent.  The latter article I believe balances the collective tone of the references, and does not omit mention of the Honduras accusations.

However, I have retained the old article here:

Weird World of Wikipedia

By Martin J. Walker
February 2006

With this in mind, most people dealing with this issue, attempt to mitigate the problem by understanding that all knowledge is `situated' knowledge, and that all judgements come from a particular standpoint. This means that it is understood that no one can claim to be 100% ‘neutral’ or ‘objective’, and that there are always power struggles involved when someone claims to be `objective` (especially whilst engaging in partisan behaviour).

17 November 2005.
http://www.theoneclickgroup.co.uk/documents/ME-CFS_docs/More%20Wikipedia%20On%20Wessely.doc

One Click seems to me to be a bunch of paranoid zealots. And I   will state again that before I tried to tone down the shit they put on the Wessely page I had never heard of them or Simon Wessely.
 Just Z  G, you know? [T]/[C] AfD? 15:46, 
19 December 2005
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Simon_Wessely

A conservative estimate of the number of adults and children suffering from ME suggests that there are around 250,000 in the UK, yet it is rarely diagnosed by the medical profession, is fleetingly mentioned in government research funding documents, is seldom accepted by medical research workers, and is almost never admitted to by insurance companies. 

TABSince 1986, while gathering around him an entourage of like minded disciples which has become known as the Wessely School, Professor Simon Wessely, has almost single-handedly been responsible for the strategy of a moratorium on the investigation of ME as an illness  with a physically neurological cause. Professor Wessely is a psychiatrist, and for nearly twenty years he has promulgated the idea that ME and the broader groupings of chronic fatigue illnesses (CFS) are the product of ‘false illness beliefs’, mental aberrations, which can be diagnosed and treated with psychiatric based therapies and anti-depressants. 

TABProfessor Wessely carries out research mainly in the London-based Institute of Psychiatry which is situated in King’s College teaching hospital. He is a member of numerous research organisations and advisory groups, and is advisor to the British Armed Services. While his membership of an ‘official’ web of research organisations tell us a lot about his work, added substance to his views is to be found in his more informal and less renowned associations with a number of minority-view groups set up by, or aligned with US and British ‘quackbuster’ organisations. 

TABJust before Christmas 2005, the Wikipedia, an electronic and sometimes publicly edited encyclopaedia, was host to a small, anonymous entry about Professor Wessely. The entry appeared to have originated with someone opposed to Wessely’s psychiatric view of ME. On seeing this entry, Jane Bryant of the One Click (OC) campaign substituted a longer text, which contained not just biographical facts but a broader description of Wessely’s role in the politics of ME. 

TABWhen this longer text was seen by the Wikipedia ‘edit police’ who cruise the pages seeking ‘vandalism’ and 'skewed' edits, it was immediately considered to break most of Wikipedia’s self serving rules. On writing to the owner and founder of Wikipedia, ‘Jimbo’ Wales, in an attempt to put their case, the OC campaign received a personal communication from him. 

Although Wales, aimed at a slight up-beat and reconciliatory tone in his e-mail, the text was scattered with veiled insults. He accused One Click participants of ‘behavioural problems’, while stating that OC organisers had lied and purposefully made libellous statements in their posted piece on Wessely. He made clear even at this early stage of the exchange that Wikipedia would from then on act on the basis that ‘anything from your site (will be treated) with extreme scepticism.’ Jimbo Wales, ended his e-mail with an exhortation for everyone to settle differences and unit in the spirit of Wikichristmas. 

TABWhen, however, OC answered Jimbo with a rebuttal of his argument in favour of an orthodox objectivity and neutrality – ‘we are not going to be advocates for or against either side in this dispute’ - the debate entered another level.

TABIt seems possible that Professor Wessely, having been alerted to his Wikipedia entry began to liaise with Wikipedia and the business of drafting a  Soviet-style biographical text about him was given to the indulgently named Just Zis  Guy, you know? (Clearly I have no intention of using this onanistic sobriquet in this essay and so will refer to him as ZG)

You're on an encyclopaedia. It's Wikipedia's job to explain things. While we do try to limit spoilers, there's usually not much we can to do and searching Wikipedia for something will tend to spoil it. I read Star Trek XI's plot before watching it because I knew it would be on the site. The problem is the same with any encyclopaedia in the world. If you can spot a really major spoiler, then by all means, point it out and we'll see if we can fix it. Otherwise, leave it as is. Besides, after a game or a film or whatever is out for a certain period of time, no-one cares about spoilers.

And surely this biographical article is not the right place for such an """"explanations of other side"""" (simple denial of the anti-human crime).  

Andranikpasha, your nickname expalins who are you? YOu are an armenianorigin person. Andranik indeed has been one ot he heads of the bloody Armenian militia killing Turks, Kurds and Azeris, with his terrorist acts has been the reason for the reaction of Kurds, Turks and Azeris after they returned from the war in 5 fronts. So your response is absolutly biased, because of your nationality and firm belief in an event that never occured or occurded only for the Armenian church who uses this so called armenian genocide to mobilzie armenians and prevent their assimilation. 

As to the fact this is not the page for the other side, this shows how much you are anti-democratic and biased on this issue. This is against the Wikip3edia neturality principle as well. You give one side an opportunity to jsutify her action, but the other side only one general and useless sentence. I wouldn't be surprised if you are a pro-Pelosi person. Please, don't accuse others with stupidity and etc. I know quite a lot about American politics and how it is run. I completed my studies in US. This is for your education and information. 

If I don't see any more jsutified response I will go an and extent the Turkey section and also create the Criticism section.

Fascism  is a form of radical authoritarian nationalism that came to prominence in early 20th-century Europe. Influenced by national syndicalism, the first fascist movements emerged in Italy around World War I, combining more typically right-wing positions with elements of left-wing politics, in opposition to communism, socialism, liberal democracy and traditional conservatism. Although fascism is usually placed on the far right on the traditional left–right spectrum, fascists themselves and some commentators have argued that the description is inadequate.""",[],0

Sorry for replying to you here, but I really didn't think it was appropriate for discussion on that talk page, what with the guideline about the purpose of those talk pages and all. Well, I think it had something to do with Numbuh (sorry!) One being British, and hence inserting it into the KND, either that or because the show centers around children, fighting adults, and as such, follows the following assessment: KND:""""We are against all that adults stand for, they make us go to school (spelling obviously associated with it), we're not going to obey them."""" hence the spelling of number as """"numbuh"""", or super as """"soopah"""", and all that.

"Lists that combine categories 

On the AfD for List of Jewish American criminals and victims you wrote Comment Does anyone think that this sort of list is substantially different from List of Jewish actors and actresses? If so, I'd like to understand exactly why.

I don't know if you're aware that in January 06 there was extensive discussion of the issue of lists that try and combine a person's ethnic or religious affiliation with something completely unrelated to that. The extreme example discussed at some length there was List of Methodist dentists. I missed that discussion, but having looked through it recently as I've watch the AfD comments I'm really disappointed that the community did not come to an acceptable consensus on the question. 

I see a difference between the list you cite and the list under discussion primarily because the 'criminals and victims' is so contentious and potentially offensive. We've seen the comments from User: GorillazFanAdam. While I can see some way in which a list of people who were victims because they were Jewish (gay, missionaries) could have merit (but I'm not sure it warrants inclusion on Wikipedia), I cannot see how a list of criminals could have the same merit. To act in a manner that is criminal is effectively a declaration that the faith into which you were born, or claim by conversion, is effectively a sham. So I am against the list of criminals and victims remaining not only because it not doing anything of value in the context of an encyclopedia but because it is potentially offensive.

As for the list of actors, I am against their creation since they do not seem to have encyclopedic value. Such a list combines two aspects of a person's life that do not inherently have value. A list of Jewish scholars of Christianity, for example, might be a very interesting list. There is a category combination that i see has genuine value. It was said that a List of Islamicist athletes has values because such athletes choose to recognise aspects of the Koran in the way that they compete (women wearing a burka [spelling?] for example). 

So I've come to the position that both lists you mention are unencyclopedic, but was willing to accept the view of a majority that a  List of Jewish actors and actresses was something I can put up with. A List of Jewish American criminals and victims is too contentious to remain.",[],0

Highway 61 got out much quicker, with a one-month lapse from its August 20 release before charting. Going back earlier, Another Side took about six weeks to chart and Freewheelin', more about than three months,  Using mid-July, then, means giving BoB  two weeks to debut, which is absurd.

 Regarding your edits to Ellen Pompeo and Patrick Dempsey 

I have reverted your edits to these two articles.  Please review WP:V to learn about appropriate, reliable sources for the information you keep adding, and also visit WP:LIBEL and WP:BLP to learn about appropriate information in biographical articles of living people.  Insinuating that these two individuals are having an affair or are anything other than faithful to their respective significant others is libelous, and against Wikipedia policy.  You have not provided a reliable source to support the POV suggested by your edits.  WP:NPOV will help you learn about Wikipedia's neutral point of view policy.  

The quotes you keep adding are taken out of contexttheir mentions of a """"crush"""" on each other were done in a joking manner, and another cast member followed their comments by saying she had a crush on both of thembut that's not grounds for speculating that the cast member in question is having an affair with both of them, and if I said or insinuated that she were, that would be libel.  These quotes are cast members speaking highly of each other, and frankly, good public relations by supporting their on-screen chemistry and by extension, that of the fictional characters they play.  Many other cast members have complimented their co-stars, including PD and EP, but no reliable source has, to my knowledge, ever published information that these two were anything other than co-stars who happen to be friends.  On the contrary, both speak frequently of their significant others in high esteem (in print and on camera), and speak well of each other's partners.  If you have a reliable source for your edits, in accord with WP:Verifiability, then it's a different story, but as it is, your edits are potentially libelous and not in accord with Wikipedia editing policy.""",[],0

 from article 

In its modern form, racism evolved in tandem with European exploration, conquest, and colonization of much of the rest of the world, and especially after Christopher Columbus reached the Americas.  As new peoples were encountered, fought, and ultimately subdued, theories about """"race"""" began to develop, and these helped many to justify the differences in position and treatment of people whom they categorized as belonging to different races (see Eric Wolf's Europe and the People Without History).  Some people like Juan Gines de Sepulveda even argued that the Native Americans were natural slaves.

If nothing else, they should be included to highlight the controversy that their claim to being cherokee engenders.  Legally, they may not be recognised cherokees, but anthropologically they are.

Can any information provided by a citation that has Beckett as it's primary source be considered reliable when he changes his story constantly about something as simple as this?  What is the policy of dealing with information that comes from a person who just doesn't get things right very often?  From the numerous announced release dates that have come and gone with no actual product materializing, to not even getting the founding date of his own company correct, it seems that Geoff Beckett should be considered at least somewhat unreliable whenever he states anything.    And so, can references like the  Washington Times and The Record articles be considered sound when they are going off nothing more than what Geoff Beckett is telling them?    """,[],0
"""

I'm happy to believe that the name """"Blackbeard"""" is used to describe a character in an upcoming movie. The issue for this article is why that is sufficiently significant to the modern cultural understanding of Blackbeard, for it to warrant inclusion in the article on the historical figure. Simply stating that Blackbeard is mentioned in a modern-day film/book/comic/play doesn't tell us anything about how the historical figure is interpreted, and risks being indiscriminate information which does little to advance our understanding of the topic. I suspect before we include the fact that Blackbeard wll be mentioned in yet another modern movie, we would need to know how this mention is of enduring cultural significance. I also doubt that the real-life Blackbeard can be presented in a historically accurate context in the otherwise fictional universe of POTC> More likely, and with all respect to Ian McShane, it is likely Blackbeard will simply be a large black-bearded pirate who has matches in his beard and says """"Yarr."""" An entertaining figure no doubt, but not one that advances this article, which is about the real-life Caribbean pirate.

I don't mean this to sound snarky, so my apologies if it comes across that way. It's just that articles like this can quickly amass extensive and fairly trivial lists of mentions, including every time the subject is even referred to in sitcoms and the like. Check out the page history from about a year ago, to see what I mean. I'd prefer not to return to simple lists of mentions, even when Blackbeard is a major character in the film/novel/comic/TV episode. Instead and for what its worth, I support Parrot's suggestion of mentioning it at the film's article, where it has apropriate context.

I protest not for the sake of arguing but for the sake of independence, for the sake of speech freedom, for the sake of liberty. I returned to Wikipedia with this account as I said in my first contribution that """"[t]he first course of action I must take is pursue defense of my actions on my previous account"""". I was blocked before I had settled that matter. I had not had the chance to become a constructive editor because I was not finished with my pursuit of justice. However, cum laude I left my streak on Bode Miller to the first sentence with my only mainspace edit. My contribution to that renowned, reformed skier will prevail for many years to come. My first argument against my block is that Jpgordon, an involved administrator, blocked me. This is an utter no-no on Wikipedia — an involved administrator, who himself is the epitome of most administrators (abusive, unkind, and unjust [not a personal attack]), blocking someone he dislikes. Through my praxeological observations, I have realized that Josh clearly demonstrates cui bono. By this unjust block, Wikipedia is regressing, I daresay, regressing into the reign of terror.

I propose that this block be dealt with in one of two of the following ways:
My block be reduced to one month, several months, or even a year. If I really am not a constructive editor, I wouldn't return. As devoted as I am, I will always strive to become useful here.
My block be lifted. I will strive to make constructive additions to Bode Miller and other great Olympians. I will refrain from editing any talk pages so that I will not have any chance to """"troll"""" or """"harass"""". If I ever start trolling again, block me forthwith. After a couple months, allow me to edit talk pages again so I can work to develop mutual understanding with my fellow Wikipedians. Once I do anything you do not like, block me. How much vandalism can I inflict when at least six administrators are watching me?

My last request is that an uninvolved administrator adjudicate between Jpgordon and me. , , ,  (for their posts on my talk page) and  and  (for their posts at the Administrators' noticeboard) are now involved, so please find an uninvolved administrator to review this. 

If you worry about my not being constructive if I am unblocked, I ask that whoever is handling this request exsert those worries. After having been blocked for """"[d]isruptive editing"""" on my previous account, I returned with this one. I returned to make amends. I returned to set right everything I disordered. I returned to assert my concerns. I returned with the hope of maintaining this stately encyclopedia, and I partially fulfilled this here. I would like to continue perfecting this great community. My last hope when I returned was to get blocked again, this time indefinitely, but instead to participate in the creation of an online encyclopedia destined to become the essence of Internet, the essence of knowledge, and the essence of perfection.

As Carl Rogers once said, """"If we value independence, if we are disturbed by the growing conformity of knowledge, of values, of attitudes, which our present system induces, then we may wish to set up conditions of learning which make for uniqueness, for self-direction, and for self-initiated learning"""". I believe just that and hope to introduce it to the Wikipedia community.

"No indeterminates in the reals? 
Of course there are indeterminates in the real numbers - can you provide a complete representation in *any* number system for those numbers we call irrational? The answer is no. Even if it were possible for 0.999... to equal 1, it breaks the decimal system as it was intended since its invention. Do you agree that not all real numbers can be represented in a radix system? If yes, why would you insist on having a cauchy sequence define a number?  Just because you can list the first few terms says nothing about the limit. For example, you can provide a Cauchy sequence that 'represents' pi but you cannot find its limit. There are several contradictions in this branch of 'analysis' - All Cauchy sequences must have limits but you cannot find the actual limit of 'most' Cauchy sequences that represent the majority of real numbers you cannot represent completely.

 Popular Music Sites 

Hi Wesley,

You mentioned that PureVolume, being a website for bands to host mp3s, is not suitable as a source.  Is this because a source should be a 3rd-party human being who has done original research or synthesis?  I realize that PureVolume (and any site that collects and presents data about usage) can present results that are made inaccurate through sockpuppets, but it still ends up being less slanted and biased than human beings, don't you think?

There isn't really an easy way to do this. I generally use a combination of Illustrator CS and a text editor, and any knowledge on basic SVG specifications for basic types (such as default parameter values, so that certain data can be excluded). I used to use Inkscape, but it felt too clunky and produces really bloated SVG code—it is sad to say (since I support free software) that I really appreciate Illustrator, since it is slick and produces very clean SVG code. Certainly, Adobe authored the SVG specifications, so it is not surprising that Illustrator writes the best output (in my opinion). However, when opening SVG files in Illustrator that were originally saved in the Inscape SVG format, Illustrator will usually retain the """"sodipodi"""" metadata, which is specific only to that application (and Inkscape). I try to remove the sodipodi data using a text editor to keep the code to the standard SVG coding, then reopen/save in Illustrator. Another method is to save the figure as an Illustrator AI or PDF file, then reopen/save in Illustrator again to shed the sodipodi metadata. If this fails, and it is a simple circle, I redraw the object. Often I'll name objects, but remove """"Layer 1"""", since multiple layers are not needed for logos. If you can, find original artwork in PDF format, and simply open it up in Illustrator, and edit then save in SVG. This way you can avoid doing too much tweaking to get around Inkscape's annoyances. +t """,[],0

Thanks.  I'm not really that into the crises.  Bishonen and I approach Wikipedia very differently, and we can never understand why the other one doesn't get involved in Crisis X or Y that is so clearly all-important.  I care about policy.  I figure that the principle of the thing is extremely important, and if we get good policies and stick to them until it hurts (and then change them when enough people feel the pain, but only with consideration of the pains we feel and the ones we want to avoid), all will be well.  I think Bishonen cares about people, and particularly people getting stomped on by the bullies of the site.  She helps people.

I do have a plan for the articles I'm writing.  One day (I promise), I'm going to finish The Dunciad.  Well, in The Dunciad, Pope blasts a hole in about three dozen contemporaries.

 Since we are citing the Constitutions definition, it is of fundamental relevance to state that Sikhs did not accept the Constitution itself. The reason they did not accept it is because minority rights were not protected (because the Constitution did not even recognize the minorities to be separate from Hindus.)

 """"On 27th August 1947, the Constituent Assembly of India had passed a resolution that the question of minority rights in Eastern Punjab will be considered separately but subsequently minorities subcommittee recommended that no special safeguards will be provided to the Sikhs... Sikh representative Sardar Hukam Singh and Bhupinder Singh Mann had refused to append their signatures to the Constitution of India and Sardar Hukam Singh on 21st November, 1949 declared in the Constituent Assembly  “Let it not be misunderstood that the Sikh community has agreed to this Constitution. I wish to record an emphatic protest here. My community cannot subscribe its assent to this historic document.”""""

""""no special safeguards will be provided to the Sikhs"""" is equal in part to Sikhs not being regarded as a distinct minority.

Some of this discussion seems to have gotten a little heated, but I think the main goal remains the same of having a good encylopedia and having good articles within it. The subjects involved, both MHFM and the others mentioned - may seem obscure to the general reader but are figures of note within the theological/philsophical schools of which they represent. The sedevacantist position is of serious interest to those studying the ramifications of Vatican II on the largest single religious denomination on the planet, and stands as a serious challenge to those who accept Vatican II and those who refuse and resist it (such as the Society of Saint Pius X) but still hold that Francis is a legitimate Pope (despite his endorsement of Vatican II). Due to the sedevacantist rejection of contempory Vatican authority it makes sense that there are competing schools within this segment of post Vatican II Catholicism, and in a culture obsessed with concerns such as """"What will Amanda Bynes tweet next?"""" it stands to reason that they are paying much attention to debates over things like the rubrics of the tridentine rite. But it would be a disserve to the goal of the encyclopedia to ignore these intellectual schools of thought. Surely if wikipedia can have an article on every piece of music made by Paris Hilton, we can find a way to capture the interactions and debates between schools of thought that will continue for generations to come. 

It is Wikipedia practice to use a person's published thoughts as a legitimate source that can be cited as a quotation about that person's opinion...i.e. a person's tweets can be quoted in that person's wikiarticle (citing the twitter page's url) even though they are were not printed in full by a media organization. It would seem that such an approach could be used here citing Ibranyi by quoting his online work as an indication of his own thought, as long as an encylopedic manner was maintained.174.53.163.243  """,[],0

"Hazel Eyes 

Hi, I noticed you had reverted my changes to the hazel eye section however left me a message informing me I could contact you on your talk page providing more information. I've numerously tried to get Wikipedia to change the hazel eye color section as it's informing people that hazel eyes can be gold/brown and green (either could be dominant) which is a myth as a hazelnut doesn't contain any significant green colouration whatsoever, it is true that sometimes very minimal green tints are present in a brown eye to produce a golden glow and create the hazel colour but hazel eyes can never be eyes that are significantly green with slight brown/gold admixture, that is a North American misconception which is believed to have occurred in the past 100 years or so, as in Europe the origin of light/coloured eyes and hazelnuts, the true/original meaning is still used. The problem is there is no documentation on hazel eye definitions changing throughout the years nor has there ever been a study conducted tracing back to how the myth/misconception in North America came about, it's more of an assumption that people have come to realize as North Americans have started inaccurately identifying eyes that are significantly green with slight brown admixture as well as eyes that are blue or grey with brown admixture; as the colour hazel because they're multi-coloured and appear to change in different lighting even though they don't resemble the colour of a hazelnut in any way. It's an issue/myth that requires common sense to understand really, so even though I cannot provide you with documentation or studies concerning the changes of hazel eye definitions becoming misconceived in North America I can provide you with numerous sources/pictures of what hazel eyes are supposed to be and what the colour 'hazel' is described as being;

http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/hazel (defines it as a light golden brown colour, after a hazelnut)

http://www.fanteye.com/extimages/p_FreshlooksColorblendsChartLG.jpg (shows a pure hazel eye, big difference to the green eye diagonally below to the right)

http://ygraph.com/chart/2990 (shows hazel as a honey/beige brown colour and categorizes is next to another brown eye rather than green)

http://www.colormecontacts.com/colored-contacts-for-dark-eyes (puts hazel eyes in the same category as honey, not green plus displays a green eye with abit of brown under the green category)

http://www.yestheyrefake.net/color_contacts_buy_photos.htm (shows hazel eyes in numerous pictures presenting them as a golden brown)

http://hazeleyes-wintergoddess.blogspot.com.au/2009/07/hazel-eyes.html (states the North American misconception and the true/original European definition while showing examples of various sources, numerous pictures and comments below of people agreeing and showing gratitude)

http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_definition_of_Hazel_eyes (states the misconception and says that hazel eyes are supposed to match the hazel or cob nut, the fruit of the hazel bush/tree that grows in Europe)

http://m.rateitall.com/iPhone/item.aspx?p=0&ItemID;=1074601 (shows an optometrists opinion/experience with the issue while stating the North American hazel eye misconception and providing sources backing up his statement)

I would also like to state the very first reference to eyes ever being compared to the colour 'hazel' was by William Shakespeare in Romeo & Juliet in which he was comparing a persons eyes to the reddish brown colour of a ripe hazelnut; Mercutio: “Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes;–what eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?” Act 3. Scene I Romeo and Juliet 
Source: http://blog.wordnik.com/shakespeare-soup

Considering William Shakespeare was an English writer it does prove the original intension/purpose of calling a persons eyes the colour hazel was to compare them to the colouration of either a light golden brown hazelnut or a reddish darker brown hazelnut and never a green and gold/brown mix or any multi-coloured eye (blue, grey or green with brown around the pupil) as a hazelnut doesn't present any blue, grey or green colouration nor is the colour 'hazel' described as possessing any of these colours. I only hope you're more understanding of this issue and can agree with what i'm saying, I strongly think you should keep my last changes to the hazel eye section so people can understand/know about what hazel eyes are supposed to be rather than leaving the information as it is feeding people with the North American myth. That being said the hazel eyes picture on the right of the hazel eye section isn't green or gold in any way it's actually a blue eye with significant brown around the pupil, the hazel eye section doesn't say anything about haz",[],0

 I'm sorry but you are factually WRONG.  As an Automotive Engineer, with a keen interest in vehicle dynamics, I can assure you that traction control and EDL are operate in two very different methods.  All traction control systems monitor differential axle wheel speeds comparing the driven axle to the non-driven axle - any differences outside the scope of the allowed tollerances will ONLY result in either (a) BOTH driven wheels on the same axle being braked, or (b) the engine ECU reducing engine output, or (c) a combination of (a) and (b).  EDL does NOT compare differences between front and rear axles, it ONLY compares differences between the left and right wheels on the same axle, and brakes just ONE wheel, there is NO engine power intervention.  Whilst they are both """"add-on"""" functions of modern ESP systems, and use the same related hardware and electronics, the software control of the two different systems are distinctly separate, and help moderate/control different aspects of vehicle dynamics.

 Three phases of post-WWII relationships between Romania and the Soviet Union 

OK, I've done some research and I'm sure I still don't know as much as the rest of you but at least I am not as much of an ignoramus as I was a few hours ago.

I've looked at a number of online resources, most of them non-scholarly, but I think it's enough to get a feel for what the situation is.  The source that I found most useful is: this one.

It's clear that there were at least three phases of relationship between Romania and the Soviet Union after WWII.  The first was """"legal occupation"""" between 1944 and 1946/47.  As Hamish and Prete say, """"The occcupation lasted legally from the signature of the armistice until February 1947, when peace treaties were signed in Paris...""""

The next phase of the relationship involves a nominally independent Romania that is """"closely aligned"""" with the Soviet Union and COMECON.  As for Soviet troops, Hamish and Prete say """"[after 1947], Soviet troops remained, but on a different legal basis, in Romania and Hungary.  The official reason was that (the Soviets) needed to control communications between the Soviet Union and Soviet occupation forces in Austria.  This reason disappeared with the conclusion of the Austrian State Treaty in 1955.  Instead, Soviet forces remained as Allied troops, and their status was more precisely defined with the signature in 1958 of the Warsaw Pact.""""

Now, we know that the Soviet troops were pulled out of Romania in 1958 and that Ceausescu took Romania on a path that diverged from COMECON but still remained enough in Khruschev's good graces that Romania never suffered a military incursion as Hungary or Czechoslovakia did.

The point here is that there are at least three phases of relationship between Romania and the Soviet Union.  The relationship between 1944 and 1946/47 was clearly one of occupation.  After 1958, everyone agrees that there was no more occupation of Romania.  However, between 1946/47 and 1958, it's not clear what people call it.  As Hamish and Prete state, the """"legal occupation"""" ended.  As cited here and in Soviet occupation of Romania, some sources state that the """"Soviet occupation"""" ended in 1958.  Others call it a """"virtual occupation"""".  Why virtual?  Because it had all the earmarks of an occupation except that it wasn't officially one.  (And thus my argument that we shouldn't call it an occupation because it wasn't one.)

What's the solution?  Here's my proposal...

First, stop getting caught up in what the title of the article says.  Let the Soviet occupation of Romania article remain where it is.  Mention the entire period of 1944-1958 under this title (i.e. Soviet occupations) but make it clear that there were three phases of relationship and, as I described it, """"the period from 1946/47 to 1958 had many of the characteristics of an occupation but was not legally considered to be an occupation"""".  Also add that many historians follow the lead of the Romanian government in calling the entire period from 1944-1958 an occupation by the Soviet Union.  

However, also note that it is unclear whether this characterization is used by """"most historians"""", """"many historians"""" or """"some historians"""".  In Soviet occupation of Romania, the text says """"most Western historians"""" but the references simply provide a handful of sources that use the word """"occupation"""" to refer to the period 1944-1958.  As someone argued, this could be just cherry-picking.  To support the assertion that """"most Western historians consider the period 1944-1958 to be a Soviet occupation"""", you have to find a source that says exactly that i.e. the text has to say """"most Western historians blah, blah, blah"""".  Failing that, using the word """"most"""" is OR.  Much better to say """"many"""" or just """"some"""".

Note that the blocking admin responded to my request for an unblock at Wikipedia:ANI#User:Shaheenjim.  In it, he alleged that a single revert, along with discussions on the talk page, is edit-warring.  Obviously an allegation that laughable is evidence that it's a pretext, and his real motivation is retaliation, since he's involved in the dispute.

He also cited two prior blocks.  First of all, note that two or three alleged violations over the course of years of productive editing is nothing.  And second, those other two blocks were both ridiuclous too.  In one I was blocked for violating the 3RR, even though I only reverted 3 times in a day.  And in the other I was blocked for allegedly posting OR, even though I posted a source, so obviously it wasn't OR. -   23:09",[],0

"""::::Your statements in this section have suggested that an Orthodox Jew who doesn't strictly follow Orthodox halakha is a Conservative Jew, and that a Conservative Jew who doesn't strictly follow Conservative halakha is a Reform Jew. That's simply not the case. Every religion has a normative set of rules, and some people don't follow them. Conservative Judaism isn't a movement for lapsed Orthodox Jews, and Reform Judaism isn't a movement for lapsed Conservative Jews. These movements are not distinguished by different degrees of observance of Orthodox law; they each have their own philosophy of Judaism and how it should be practiced. 

Conservative Judaism has a """"strict"""" halakha that it believes is a continuation of the rabbinic tradition. It expects Conservative Jews to follow that law. The fact that many Conservative Jews don't follow the movement's halakha may be notable, but it doesn't mean that Conservative Judaism has no halakha.

You ask if """"all facets of CJ today claim to be working in the continuation of Rabbinic proccess or not?"""" I don't know what you mean by """"all facets"""" — are you referring to members of the Rabbinical Assembly or individual Conservative Jews? I don't know that every member of the Rabbinical Assembly is in agreement, but the Conservative movement's view is that it is continuing the historical process of rabbinic interpretation and halakhic evolution that has been going on for more than 2000 years.

Are there """"some elements"""" within the Conservative rabbinate who don't strictly follow the decisions of the RA? Absolutely. I'm sure that there were Conservative rabbis who were officiating at civil unions before the movement said it was okay. I was too young to know, but I imagine that some Conservative synagogues may have included women in a minyan before the RA said it was alright. And there may be Conservative synagogues that won't include women even if the RA says that they must. I don't know, but I think that they believe that they are acting within the rabbinic tradition. I doubt that any of them is saying """"Halakha be damned, I'm going to do whatever I want.""""

Yes, the Conservative movement """"by its nature expands the boundaries of their interpetation of the law."""" It calls it """"evolution,"""" and it makes no secret of it. Its viewpoint is that Akiva and Hillel and Rambam and every other rabbi in Jewish history has done the same thing — until the reactionary Orthodox movement slowed the process to a snail's pace.

Anyway, I think this discussion is going way off track. I'm sorry for the tone of my earlier comments, but saying that Conservative Jews are lapsed Orthodox is offensive. —  (Talk | contribs)

It can be so obviously seen that you have no life in reality and hence you carry on with editing pages on Wikipedia,which is another big joke, like you. In fact, it is jokers like you that make Wikipedia an unreliable piece of crap that the world laughs on. You thought you can block users who edit articles that are wrongly written to project a """"good"""" image like that C-grade item song sleaze actress Payal Rohatgi. On the account of hello5678, when I edited to write the truth, since I work with the media and knew the actual truth, you did what you knew best - to block accounts and even have the foolish audacity to write that it did not seem I was a journalist. Your block anyways went futile ( like all your remaining blocks on other users go, and future blocks will be going ) since as I had said, there are a million computers to comment and reply from. It just depends on my wish if I want to respond to idle losers like you and whether I have the time to do so. Once and for all, I am doing it this time, and won't remove time for worthless people like you again.

You had some advice on how I should spend my """"blocked time"""" by reading WP:Dispute pages on Wikipedia so that I have better ideas on dealing with disputes. Actually ,you need better ideas to deal with life. I am not foolish like you to spend any amount of my time bothering about rubbish written by stupid people like you who have no work in real life and spend days editing pages on Wikipedia/ Scribblebook that no one bothers to read. Some people are just unfortunate like you and 2over0. And if you are troubled by my calling that actress """"sleazy"""", then that's your problem. Cos that's the only work she has done and the press uses precisely that term while referencing her work. You also spoke about writing """"accurate"""" information on wikipedia. Ironic, when you don't even bother finding out what is accurate, and spend endless hours blocking, and acting admin as if it is an important position in yourCarry on with your scribble game. And if you feel threatened by media exposure, then that shows you knew you were wrong. It's only when people are wrong that they feel threatened. Pity your personality. Also, you ended by writing that """" it's clear you aren't a journalist, and have no means of carrying out your threat """" - LOL. Sad, that you lived in that illusion. For JOKERS like you who are totally idle,and who scribble away in virtual  life. Oh wait, that may be the only position you probably have or will have ever in your unfortunate life.

Carry on with your scribble game. And if you feel threatened by media exposure, then that shows you knew you were wrong. It's only when people are wrong that they feel threatened. Pity your personality. Also, you ended by writing that """" it's clear you aren't a journalist, and have no means of carrying out your threat """" - LOL. Sad, that you lived in that illusion. For JOKERS like you who are totally idle,and who scribble away in virtual pages on Wiki-scribble-pedia, will obviously withdraw from the truth. You yourself have no idea at all if I am a journalist, and you write that it's clear that I am not. Well, you are also inane and a clown to fool yourself. I had all means, and the said article has already been published. I had NO TIME to let you know, since I am a busy person, unlike you and do not find time to come scribble on virtual pages that clowns like you , 2OVERO, 2/0, AKERANS, MANAGERARC, FISHERQUEEN (yeah, we named you again - Suck it up),  KURU etc. do all your life. You will find that information, depending on which Godforsaken part of the world you live in.  And like last time, you can go ahead and block me this time too.

 What 

The fuck is going on here................ I don't even know if I should bother trying to fix this or just use my second account permanently. Shit, Indrian and Times probably playing some shit game here pretending to act like me and got all this shit on my page. I knew there was something wrong with those assholes when i saw them the first time. Guess I'll have to abandon this account. Hey  you still need to learn how to read links! Don't think I forgot! This isn't funny asshole! Guess what? I have been using another account and you don't even know what it is since the very first time I was blocked! Ha, keep playing your games, you aren't preventing me from editing piece of shit. Oh and  don't think I forgot about your 5 year old temper issues when anyone tries and fixes issues with your precious Dreamcast punk ass bitch. Lol, you guys did a number on this account. Probably found out what program I was using for the first BS account you made. 

I am impressed with how much damage you have done to this account, but it really means nothing when I am still editing every day on my personal internet and you have no idea which account it is. Oh and no it's not using a proxy or a public wifi spot. Heck, I may even try reporting this, all you idiots did was use proxy's, if I post on this account on my personal connection, and THEN appeal this I might just get my account back and get you idiots banned. I know exactly what you are going to do after this to wait until I log off, and then pounce with a new account. Sadly, looking at all this crap in my talk page, an admin would have to be retarded to not see how many of these """"accounts"""" that are proxies and not actual connections. You can only hide the smell of rotten fish for awhile before someone notices.

Shit, may was well clean this shit up. 

Oh wait a second one more thing, , what kind of retarded admin are you when having a bunch of almost all accounts pretending to be me are all on proxies and not ONE of them acts like me (did you even see my history?), and not one uses a real connection? Got that brain damage you do. had to put that in bold to be clear. Warning me about an indefinite block, lol, what does that matter, you already screwed up noticing what a 5 year old would have noticed by now. Any person would be frustrated by the silliness of this nonsense. I would appeal but something tells me to much shit damage and retarded admins will make this impossible, and I would rather not use the IP of my other account (using a real connection n my personal internet) because then you guys will probably be jackass and deleted for fun, look at this page! All this shit and nothing clicked in your small head? Amazing wikipedia. 

Also I need to take note to stay away from low ranked video game pages and focus on popular until you guys get tired of the act.

Also I KNOW you guys got an account that is going to post a bit after I submit this post I SAW him and he did the EXACT same thing 3 of the duded did, you guys need help, I can't believe not one guy was not like """"this shit don't make sense"""" for a whole second. Amazing.

Alright, so clean this page and leave this message here. Erase other extra crap. Alright, looks like we are in business. BTW, I know this is probably bull, but if any of you two actually are not trolling, which is highly unlikely, than post request an admin to come by so I can clear this account up. But I have this sinking feeling you guys all knew what's been going on here this whole time, and I have no patience to search through tons of pages to find ONE contact I can talk to about this block, so you might have this account, but you won't get the other one. Suck doesn't it? Until then, I will be going about my day and you guys will most likely probably still be doing this for X amount of days cause I guess you think it's funny? Yeah.

There is  something really wrong with the administration of Wikipedia, and I am not the only one to know about and complains!.

 You are one of the most pathetic administrators on this site. 

This is just plain sad. I am a susbcriber to Jane's Intelligence online, and I found the article easily. (you need to be a subscriber to access it, but it is certainly not hard to find). If you tally up the total UDA/UVF/LVF killed in the book lost lives (from 1968-1998) it shows 90 Loyalists killed by the IRA and INLA during that time period. The book """"The Irish War"""" also gives the number of 90, on the page I quoted, as does the Jane's intelligence report. That is THREE sources to the one source you quote. I am sick of having my hard work hacked up by some half-assed administrator who can't deal with the fact that his IRA article was full of innacuracies. I have contacted a friend of mine who is a senior administrator, you should be recieving an E-mail from him shortly. Unless you want your administrator privilages revoked, I suggest you either stop re-editing my article, or merge my facts with your own. I am pissed that I took the time to re-submit the article in the way you asked, and you are still throwing a hissy fit. You are one of the worst administrator's I have ever dealt with, you are the reason academics don't respect Wikipedia. 

PS. I realize you are a Loyalist terrorist supporter, and therefore can't deal with the fact that the IRA killed a large number of UDA/UVF/LVF members...but those are the historical facts, grow up and deal with it.

You have been blocked from editing for a period of 31 hours for your disruption caused by edit warring and violation of the three-revert rule at The Amazing Race 21. During a dispute, you should first try to discuss controversial changes and seek consensus. If that proves unsuccessful you are encouraged to seek dispute resolution, and in some cases it may be appropriate to request page protection.

I love how two editors can gang up on a third, including being so nasty that one of them draws a block for incivility, and it's me who ends up getting fucked by their bad faith actions. Excellent evidence for the proposition that when you give anyone a little power they'll abuse it. Great decision. Spot fucking on. Buck Winston (talk) 
[edit]Hmm

(Non-administrator observation) I've only taken a cursory look at the article, but it looks like you made a good point - I can only think of a handful of shows to have featured three gay characters in a season, and I'd agree with you that it should definitely be put in that category. Regardless, if you plan on making more edits like this and this, you might find yourself with a block extension. Bbb23's a good administrator, and 3RR's called """"bright-line rule"""" for a reason. And considering that edit-warring blocks are to get users to cool down, if this is how you responded, it looks like he made the right call. — Francophonie&Androphilie;(Je vous invite à me parler)

I understand I am a bit late in this discussion and it has probably already concluded and everyone is probably already over it but I have to say the following; American English is quite simply English for the stupid man (and of course your country would require it.) Your version of English is over-simplified. 
I am sick of Americans always thinking that their way is the only way. Why shouldn't you accept our spelling?
 Webster was incorrect in his changing of the English language. If I was to start spelling things incorrectly would that mean that it is a new way of spelling and I would be a reformist rather than an idiot? I think not. 09:04, 17",['malignant'],1

 While I respect the fact that you've obviously given this some thought, a few counterpoints: 1) Every single state in the union, with the possible exception of Rhode Island (mostly because it's so damn tiny), is a """"transitional"""" state with the features you mentioned. Examples: California includes ghettos, really rich gated comunities, hick towns (such as Watsonville, or virtually any city more than 100 miles from the coast), and the Bay Area. New York? Same deal, if you've ever been to upstate New York you'll see. And of course, the reverse is true too - a lot of Texas is really nice, progressive even. I've heard some less-than-terrible things about Birmingham, Alabama. Even Okla-dumbass-homa has some okay parts of Tulsa. So I honestly believe that you're about 180 degrees on this one - your statement, while eloquent, was somewhat meaningless, whereas History makes some valid points (the most valid of which is that if you (speaking in the generic, non-threatening second person) call me a """"southerner"""", I will tie you to the back of a pickup truck and drag you to your death while throwing beer cans out the window to hit you in your skull.

My contribution which, apparently, was worth """"fuck all"""" and was """"piss poor"""" is currently featured in the article.

The Arabs were the ones who illegally colonized and continue to illegally occupy Israel. Nableezy is also an anti-Semite.

"""==BLACK SLANG==
This article suggests that using """"bitch"""" to describe a young woman is exclusive to hip hop culture. This is not the case. This is THE prominent term to describe a woman in the African-American community. How many black people do you know who actually call a woman a woman? None. They all say """"bitch"""" as in """"Ah fucked dis bitch las' naht nigga. She wa' FAAAHN."""" Black people will NEVER say """"woman"""" because it is ingrained in their culture to be derogatory towards women! THAT is why it is used in hip hop, because that is black entertainment. Misogyny is a crucial element of African0American culture and this is why black people throw around the word """"bitch"""" as a synonym for """"woman"""". It's the same way how black people never call a song a """"song"""" they will always call it a """"track"""" and if you call it a song the black people will think you're a """"square"""" ad """"not hip.""""

 UNBLOCK ME YOU ASSHOES! 

{{unblock|HAHAHAHA!!!

One of my favorite and most vivid memories was of a party I attended in high school. It was near the end of the year, and everyone was letting loose. The party had not gotten too badly out of control, and was finally winding down.

I was dating Karen at the time. We'd been going out for about six months. We knew our time together was growing short since we'd soon be heading off to college, she to Radcliffe, and I to Johns Hopkins. We were taking every chance we could to be intimate. I'd been with a few girls before, but Karen had been my first long term intimate relationship, and we'd taught each other lots.

The party was at Keith's house and we were helping him clean up. There were only six of us left, Karen and I, Keith, his girlfriend Linda, Tom and his girlfriend Sue. Linda lived just a few doors down and had invited Karen and Sue to spend the night. Tom was going to spend the night at Keith's house. Conveniently, Linda's parents were out of town until tomorrow noon, so nobody really had anywhere they had to go, and once we'd done a fair job of cleaning up we are able to sit back and relax.

Keith was my best friend. We had a lot in common, even if we were a bit of a """"Mutt and Jeff"""" in appearance. Both of us tall, I had a wide body, result of my Hawaiian ancestry, while he was lean and blonde. I'm 6'1"""" but he had a good 2 inches on me, and had long hair past his shoulders. Mine is brown and curly, and usually just goes whereever it wants. I'm strong as an ox, he's lean and fast. But we had similar taste in women. On more than one occasion I teased him that there was no way he deserved to be with Linda, our high-school goddess, and he was extremely envious that I had Karen, our big-breasted sexy bombshell, as my partner.

Karen and Sue were close friends. If we'd had Diana here, the triumvirate would have been complete. They had all been innocents until that year. Diana was dating, and Karen told me that she and Ryan were 'almost there', doing everything except the final act. Karen hadn't done much of anything until we'd gotten together. But we didn't let grass grow under us, and we made up for a lot of lost time. We'd had sex plenty, and she'd sucked me off more times than I can count. I'd even fucked her incredible tits a couple of times. Sue, it turns out, was the late bloomer. She was still an innocent according to Karen. Kissing was as far as she'd gone, although it seems she'd rubbed Tom's dick through his pants, and he'd had his hands on her mound, even if the underwear was still in the way. But Karen was hinting that this party might be Tom's lucky night.

We were joking about some of the antics that had been going on at the party. Linda in particular was a lurker; she'd sit back and watch all the activities at the party and was always good for a few laughs.

""""There were some really desperate people here tonight,"""" she said. """"Can you believe Gary tried to get a game of Spin the Bottle going?""""

""""I can't say I really blame him,"""" I answered with a grin. """"Not every guy there is as fortunate as us to have such gorgeous girlfriends, or any girlfriend for that matter. Hell, I wouldn'd mind playing it now!"""" That earned me a poke in the ribs from Karen.

Sue chimed in, """"Why is it that every party ends up with some lame guy trying to start some stupid game like Spin the Bottle, Post Office, or Strip Poker?""""

""""Now that's a stupid question,"""" Keith answered.

""""And why is that?"""" Linda asked, pointedly.

""""Isn't it obvious?"""" Keith replied.

""""No."""" Linda and Sue answered in unison.

""""Do you want to tell them?"""" Keith asked me with a nod.

So I explained the obvious. """"Because they ARE desperate - and sometimes it works.""""

""""Oh please!"""" Karen said.

Keith was a real instigator. """"You guys have never played Spin the Bottle?""""

The girls looked at each other. """"Maybe a few times, but certainly not in the last year."""" Linda finally answered.

""""And how about Truth or Dare?"""" Keith continued egging them on.

""""Well sure, but usually only with people we know really well,"""" Karen answered this time.

""""Usually."""" Keith echoed with a grin. """"And it's not like you've never played Strip Poker.""""

The girls looked at each other quietly no one answering.

""""Oh come on,"""" I teased, """"Karen I know you've played Strip Poker.""""

""""Not really. I watched part of a game, but then they chased everyone not playing out of the room. Why? I suppose you've played it?"""" She asked with a dangerous tone in her voice.

""""Sort of. In camp we started a game but it got raided before we got anywhere."""" I confessed, drawing a laugh from the guys. """"L","['malignant', 'rude', 'abuse']",1

The aramaena peoples are an extinct pseudo people who never existed since the Assyrians destroyed their kingdom and reduced it to a vassal state you mongrel. This Aramean Syriac name is a name created by radical separatists who deny their ethical heritage since the late 1980s you snake. The Assyrians speak modern Aramaic the Aramaic in which Christ spoke 2 thousand years ago you uneducated mule. Your statements lack depth in all facets; they are unencylcopediatic, unsourced, close minded, uneducated, mentally degenerate comments that seek to downsize the most ancient people down to nothing. You claim that this name was invented by some new comers almost a hundred years ago, this comment alone shows how completely incompetent you are. I have documents that are hundreds of years old that have been passed down through my family over the centuries that specifically speak about the Assyrians and how this name is far more ancient then simple minded people like you claim. This will be the only comment I will make for you because I will not waste my time speaking to a mentally degenerate pig such as yourself who is a denialist, racist, and complete bigot and a distorter of history who denies the race of the Assyrians exist.

no business telling me anything.  FACT: commas are used in this context to
separate a list, a series, of related clauses.  Grammar is not a matter of a
""""general discussion"""" or """"chatting"""" or a """"point of view"""".  It is a technically
precise set of rules, and in this case, a set of rules that demonstrate that
the foundation of the issue is a fraud.  THIS IS NOT OPINION, IT IS FACT, IT
IS RELEVANT TO THE ARTICLE, IT IS FOUNDATIONAL TO THE ARTICLE.  I AM TALKING
ABOUT IMPROVING THE ARTICLE BY CLARIFYING THE FOUNDATION ACCORDING TO THE
RULES OF ENGLISH GRAMMAR AS ANY LITERATE PERSON CAN SEE.  AND I AM TALKING
ABOUT ADDING THE RELEVANT AND FOUNDATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL CLAUSE.

FROM TALK GUIDELINES (why don't you review them!):

 There is reasonable allowance for speculation, suggestion, and personal
knowledge on talk pages, with a view to prompting further investigation.

 make the extra effort so that other people understand you. Being
friendly is a great help.

 It is always a good idea to explain your views; it is less helpful for you to
voice an opinion on something and not explain why you hold it.

 Article talk pages should be used to discuss ways to improve an article;

 Deal with facts

 The talk page can be used to """"park"""" material removed from the article due to
verification or other concerns, while references are sought or concerns
discussed.

 The talk page is particularly useful to talk about edits.

 New proposals for the article can be put forward for discussion
by other editors if you wish.

 Do not threaten people: For example, ...
having them banned for disagreeing with you.

 removing others' comments is sometimes allowed.
But you should ... stop if there is any objection.

As I previously posted here: THE ARTICLE SHOULD BE IMPROVED by making it clear
in the opening statement that the entire issue is a fraud upon the public
since there is no """"natural born citizen"""" requirement that is applicable today.
That is fundamental to an informative relevant foundation to the article, not
a matter of opinion, and a matter of grammatical fact.

If I say """"No animal except a mouse, or a rat, at the time I give the signal,
shall be captured"""", then I am saying only mice and rats shall be captured AT
THE TIME I GIVE THE SIGNAL.  My order has no validity at any other point in
time.  Similarly, the requirement for """"natural born citizen"""" only applied AT
THE TIME OF THE ADOPTION OF THIS CONSTITUTION.  It does not apply today, and
the following clause should be part of the article, since it is the clause at
the foundation of the issue in the article:

No person except a natural born Citizen, or a
Citizen of the United States, at the time of the
Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible
to the Office of President; neither shall any
person be eligible to that Office who shall not
have attained to the Age of thirty five Years, and
been fourteen Years a Resident within the United
States.

I saw you had notability concerns about J. J. M. Roberts. I expressed the same, but another user  suggested that holders endowed chairs at major universities are almost always notable. If that's correct, I guess the question is, Is Roberts an exception to the rule?  (talk|contribs) 
Thanks for bringing this to my attention. It looks like he wrote some books too. I'm removing the tag, and hopefully someone can expand the article.

What more information needs to be added?

References, for one. Two college newspaper citations and two MySpaces doesn't cut it. I tried to look for some myself, but google yielded very few related hits. More than ten minutes of recorded output, for another. A label. Right now, the whole thing smacks of blatant self-promotion, and that isn't what Wikipedia is for.  

is there a way i can get that page(s) back so i can save it and re-enter it when they have more references?

Any admin should be able do that for you, I think.

Bill,

I don't find your un-edits a gender-based attack.  I am largely concerned with the content of the article itself, but I wonder why you put up so much opposition to my very small edit.  Surely it can't mean that much to you.

I don't want to make derogatory comments about men.  I have nothing against men, and I don't enjoy tearing people down.  You mention the term """"well-referenced"""".  I prefer for statements to be well-referenced too.  I don't think that this particular statment is well-referenced, and furthermore, I don't think that it can be well-referenced, because I don't think that it is true.  And so I wonder about the author's neutrality.  Wikipedia articles are supposed to be both neutral and well-edited, and that statement is neither.

I don't want the article to be deleted either.  I think that it serves a useful purpose, and I enjoyed reading it.  I just want to do away with that particular sentence.

Of course, if you can find evidence that American women are materialistic sluts, then we have no problem at all.  But I'm pretty sure that whoever wrote that was confusing personal opinion for universal truth.

YOU'RE CONTRADICTING YOURSELF! Basically your opinion of based on blindness and bullshit as far the """"evidence"""" you send me are considered.

Really? Puny pictures in which you can almost not see what her eye color is. You need a magnifying glass to see her eyes. Don't show such pictures cuz it just looks really sloppy and desperate, which in your case makes sense. 1(By magnifying this image up to 400%, you can clearly see her eye color looks sort of olive green, not anywhere close to brown). 2(What the f*** is this? It look horrendous. Oh and her eyes are lighter than her hair and you keep saying they're the same shade, when clearly they're not. Lets take a look at a better quality image. No brown eyes here.)

3(These eyes can still be called hazel.) 4(Hazel eyes due to their nature have the tendency to look goldish brown in certain lights, and look at Belle's hair it looks red). 5(I can clearly see her eyes are not the same as her hair, in fact take a close look when a lock of hair falls in front of her right eyes and clashes with her eyes color. The difference looks brown and hazel, instead of brown and light brown.) 6(That's not a screenshot, and by magnifying the image, her eyes look dark hazel and so not the same color as her hair) 7(400% zoom in, hazel eyes) 8(What a desperate image, you can barely see anything, 1000% zoom in and her eyes appear not to be brown again). 9(400% zoom in, hazel eyes... again)

Oh yes, the Belle merchandise that has her with brown eyes is so big, only one of the pictures you send can sort of qualify. 10 (By magnifying the image up to 400%, you can clearly see her eyes look green-like). 11(400% zoom in, hazel eyes AGAIN)

JESUS F***ING CHRIST. You preseted me with like 18 images and almost all of them have Belle with hazel eyes instead of brown. ARE YOU COLORBLIND? Don't you know how to differentiate colors. An you call this SOLID? If Belle's eyes are hazel, than those are indeed solid, verified evidence. And the screenshots aren't even from the Diamond Edition, they're from the Special Edition.

Take a look at these pics, please. Think anyone will believe you that her eyes are brown? I don't think so. These are just a couple of additions to the pictures you presented, further cementing that Belle has hazel eyes instead of brown. Since hazel is a mix of brown and green and that hazel eyes vary between almost green to almost brown, on what bases are people suppose to believe Belle's eyes are brown?

Vandalism is a good and natural response to no-lifers (as in Get a Life) who

Cash I am a walmart assocate and I do feel there is a link between Walmart managment and servant leadership, and here is why. The managers are not in charge of the store, the hourly associates are, they take orders directly from the customers. The customers are consitered under walmarts policies to be the boss, the hourly assocates are next in that order and so on. This is a backwards model that was set fourth by Sam Walton himself and is maintained by the current board. Grassroots survays are conducted every 3mos to a year, this survey is a rating of each manager, and is then reviewed by the district and Regional VP, then changes are made. Each level of management must answer to the hourly assocates, and so it is kinda a push/pull managment system. Take my own situation for an example. heres what happend, one night I am short of assocates in the deli(which is where I work) Temp logs did not get done, of course this is a major mistake, I was """"written up"""" for this. However I did not feel this was fair, so I wrote an email to our district manager explaining the situation, he then forwarded the matter to our regional VP. Our VP came to our store, flew in from bentonville mind you. To deal with the situation, he met with me for about an hour and also met with some other deli assocates. After a week he calls me and tells me that he can not get rid of the Written warning, however that all of the managers that had been informed that we where short, would be on probation for the next six months. I was satisfied with the outcome Because, While I was not fault free in the situation, management however was informed that I did not have enough people to help customers and deal with the food safty logs, and they failed to act accordingly and I was not happy with it, so in the end I punished them for their poor perfomance. So you can kinda see why they consiter it a servant leadership. 

Also Cash I hate the way you term 'vast left-wing conspiracy' I am myself a liberal and we liberals are not part of that conspiracy ideal, that would be your union leaders and right-wing large business owners, that are anti-walmart, As much as you would like to identify us liberals with the unions we are in no way assocated with them, infact most of us liberals dislike the unions just as much if not more then you right-wingers. Because the general public tends to identify unions with the democratic party and this is because most union voters, vote on the liberal side, this does not mean that they are liberals, just that they play the politics game. True liberals hate the unions and feel that they are just as bad or worse then a currupt big business. With a currupt big business atleast you know what they are and they make no bones about it, with a union they want to be your friend and then screw you. lol.

On the part about this entry being POV it is very much so POV however I have given up tring to balance it out myself the Anti-Walmart people always revert your edit and then threaten to get you banned for the three revert rule when you attempt to make any edits, its a freaking joke the way they act. However I have just taken on the Idea that they will destroy the entry to the point where people look at it and just shake their heads and how full of BS it is.""",['rude'],1

Further revisions to my cock include trying to fuck my mother with it, which I am not entirely happy about, but heck, it's a mom I remind you all I am a faggot who wouldn't risk pissing with the seat down, so you can tell my nickname is a faggoty attempt to appear edgy.

And now someone who calls himself a bucket thinks the Lord was simply exercising """"most right and proper good humor"""" in acting that way. And the person going around erasing all my comments to hide them from outsiders calls himself a """"Rambling Man"""". Very apt. This isn't an encyclopedia, it's a playground.

Presumably the use of the phrase """"Bishonen with her finger on the trigger"""" over there waa meant to be funny, but given the context of my complaint, it's just rather tragic. Still, back to the real world, where the Trayvon Martin case is actually real news, and the issues it involves are of encyclopedic value. I've found the articles myself without the help of the front page, but apparently anyone else looking for them can just go to hell (in a bucket?). All, you Lords, Hell Buckets and Rambling men get back to whatever the fuck it is you do around here, which is cleearly not creating a useful encyclopedia (at least you don't seem to be getting in the way of the people who actually managed to write the articles on the shooting and trial, so thank fuck for that).""",['malignant'],1

"Yes, there should be criticism of Schengen.  For Americans and Canadians who want to come and teach English in Schengen countries, the Schengen Agreement is a disaster.  Where before Schengen you could renew your visitor visa by simply leaving and re-entering the country you were teaching in, now you must apply for a work permit, which is a costly and difficult process for Americans and Canadians.  Now, because of Schengen, Americans and Canadians are no longer welcome in Europe to teach English. I have heard of many well intentioned ESL teachers who were travelling between, say Germany and Czech Republic and did not have the proper 'poste Schengen' visa documentation: they were arrested by the police and forcibly stuck on a plane back to America.  No sympathy for their situation, no regard for all their belongings in their flat in Prague, no concern whatsoever: they were treated like criminals breaking the law.  This is the ugly side of Schengen: it is used to keep North Americans from teaching English Europe.  The good old days are gone, replaced with aggressive border police who are looking for ESL teachers to arrest and deport.  Many English schools in Prague, for example, are complaining bitterly against Schengen, because the companies they teach English at want Americannot BritishEnglish teachers.  Further: if you are staying over 30 days on vacation in Europe you will be treated like a criminal because of Schengen: you only get 30 days to visit Europe...then you must GET OUT: or, you must get a travel visa for every single European country you are visiting.  So, for Europeans Schengen may be nice, but for foreigners it is HORRIBLE.  I hate Schengen, and I hate the EU government in Brussels.  What a bunch of fucking assholes!!! They seem to be trying to copy George BUsh with the creation of Schengen. Fuck you EU government dickheads, we ESL teachers all hate you!!!!!!!  You ruined our jobs, our profession.

"""

 You're a liar! You have been lying all along including today, and right here above! Gurubrahma, please see the following examples of lies from just today, and here I'll quote what I wrote to him earlier: 

 Kindly please stop lying if you wish me to stop pointing out your lies. It's very rude and disrespectful when I spend my time citing verifiable and reliable sources and you just lie outright, nevermind content, but even on just simply what's happening here, and here's an example of just how you just now did it before requesting that I stop calling you """"liars""""; from Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#December_8, I quote your statement and my reply to it:

 QUOTED: """"I hope that now since all editors have reached a consensus on the article, and have tried to explain you in clearest possible words the difference between numeral symbols and numeral system, you would play a more constructive role. Thanks.   

 QUOTED: Why are you lying again here? yes, lying! As you had been doing for quite some time now and as I have pointed out. The dictionary defines a lie as """"1. A false statement deliberately presented as being true; a falsehood. 2. Something meant to deceive or give a wrong impression."""" First of all, """"all editors have reached a consensus on the article"""" is a demonstrable false statement that you should know is not true and that we're having this exchange here is evidence enough that it isn't, nevermind others. Second, here's your other BIG lie, you say others """"have tried to explain you in clearest possible words the difference between numeral symbols and numeral system"""", Oh really? why don't you tell everyone here that it is I who made the clearest distinction and as far as I remember and see on the page I was the first to make it between numeral symbols and numeral system, and you should know because you have been around. I clearly distinguished in my first post between the Arabic Numerals (1, 2, 3, 4...) and the Hindu-Arabic Numeral system in a paraphragh that begins with """"- For a start,"""" Talk:History_of_Indian_and_Arabic_numerals#RFC_2 and you should especially know, not just because youhave been around, but also because what you quoted above happens to be just the paragraph under it!  And again I made the distinction in """"the clearest possible words"""" when I proposed here, as my first(!) point in an suggested outline,  Talk:History_of_Indian_and_Arabic_numerals#Suggested_outline.2C_please_consider_and_discuss """"differentiate a specific numeral script (eg, Arabic Western, Arabic Eastern, Devanagari) from the numeral system (ie, Indian-Arabic, which includes many numerals scripts), the rest of the article should maintain this, it should also keep in mind what the readers may have searched for when looking up this article and cater for those needs (eg, is the reader looking up the Arabic Western numerals script or the Indian-Arabic Numeral system?)"""", and then again zocky, who prefers my version and is against yours, made the same disctinction Talk:History_of_Indian_and_Arabic_numerals#What_this_page_is_about. The dictionary defines a liar as """"One that tells lies"""" and """"a person who has lied or who lies repeatedly"""", if you want me to stop calling pointing out your lies stop lying! csssclll ()""""

 In addition, I did *not* start the POV fork (Alternative views on Arabic numerals). 

 In addition, you are being misleading and also lying about the following """"I replied to his comment at Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#December_8, and at 22:08, asked him on Talk:Arabic numerals to respond to my comment at Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#December_8. At 22:09 he said he had already replied on that page. I replied at 22:10 saying he hasn't. At 23:38 he posted a reply on Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#December_8, and then posted a message on Talk:Arabic numerals claiming that I was blatantly """"lying"""" at 22:10 when I said he had'nt replied. Obviously, anyone who would look at the timings will take a second to figure out the truth.""""... Why do you not mention that you replied to someone else on Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#December_8 at """"deeptrivia (talk) """", which I later on found and I replied to you at """"csssclll()"""", which you should be aware of because you replied at """"Thanks. deeptrivia (talk) """" but you don't mention this above!! ~Why don't you mention it?!

Indeed, just enough so you start heiling as nazist, and you both Germany in 1939.

Fanatics are already on enough.

indeed, he is not surprised that that your fascist state was repeatedly elected několirktá as the biggest problem in the path to world peace

HE IS CURRENTLY UNDER INVESTIGATION & SO WORRIED ABOUT IT HE IS CREATING ACCOUNTS ASKING IF HE COULD BE IN TROUBLE. HE IS. THE ONLY REAL GOLDENTONY111/112 ACCOUNTS ARE ON HERE.

Some of these uploads are music, some are comedy, some are anti BNP/EDL. None are espousing a particular movement, political group or ideology. However, due to the fact that I espouse equality and fairness & am opposed to unwarranted victimisation, oppression of minorities, hatred and ignorance it seems that certain users like to think of it as a soapbox to spew their racist, misogynistic, homophobic, xenophobic and hate-filled gibberish....the BNPers, of course, are guilty of all the aforementioned.

Apparently my decision not to allow comments that are basically spam, lazy insults, illiterate ramblings and screeching from morons who don't listen (but just use the channel as their own forum) means I am anti free speech. I don't think our ancestors fought against fascism and for the right for freedom of speech to have hate-filled knuckle draggers abuse that by screeching hate-filled drivel bereft of facts, decency or, indeed, a point.

I do actively encourage freedom of speech for all, quite often letting idiots speak makes them look far more idiotic than I ever could hope. There is a difference between debate and spamming, insulting, not listening and preaching though.

I'm happy to debate, but a debate consists of two sides discussing their views, not one shouting and refusing to listen to anyone else. It is my channel and I have the right not to allow trolls, clones, neo Nazis, racists, haters and all round ne'er do wells the right to puke bile all over it....this is not suppression of freedom of speech and if anyone cares to look back through my channel they will see I actively encourage debate, but also see how so many choose to eschew debate in favour of:
1. Attempting to belittle, hurl abuse and calling me UAF/Marxist/far left/rapist/paedophile with absolutely no basis (libelous in reality).
2. Personal insults, accusing me of being a foreigner, bringing my family into it (they love a """"mum"""" insult) and accusing me of being several users because they can't believe more than one person can disagree.
3. Misquoting, paraphrasing and cherry picking """"research"""" from questionable sources and only ever """"research"""" or accept sources that back up their own beliefs.
4. Lying, accusing me of acts I haven't done and claiming they have """"won"""" the argument when they have ignored the points I raised and just harped on and on.
5. Cloning my account on here and also using my username on far right forums. They have cloned me numerous times.
6. Waffling on about being deprived of freedom of speech (to make insults and allow no right to reply by blocking me from their channels)

Basically, these goons make up a tiny minority of incredibly arrogant, ignorant, spiteful, indecent, amoral, borderline illiterate joy sappers; BNP, EDL, neo Nazis, Islamophobes, extremists, KKK, you name it. THEY are what is wrong with the world and they are what is trying to stop us evolving; their motivation is hatred and ignorance....proven by their labelling of everyone who disagrees with them as communists, UAF, Marxists and Liberals (and more unbelievably fascists?!?) with no basis. Of course, they are just lazy epithets to group the majority into one category when their opposition is made up of a multitude of individuals from left to right, of different coloured skin and beliefs, sexualities, classes, background etc....the majority basically.

Youtube grants these guttersnipes the anonymity to parade their ignorance and disgusting ideals and appear to be a larger group than they are. They are fooling themselves though, they will always be a minority of failures who blame their own failure in life on everyone but themselves. Ironically, our ancestors who fought for every freedom they treasure now are having it spat back in their face with every ill informed, erroneous, indecent and anti educational rant these idiots post.

I encourage debate, NOT bickering, childish playground taunts or interminable clowns on their soapbox refusing to listen to others. It is still possible to get a viewpoint across without resorting to actions a 5 year old would sneer at.

These types are incredibly easy to expose for what they are, they do half the job themselves and not one of them has yet """"defeated"""" me or shut me up. Not only do I have the majority on my side but also facts and common sense.....they have none of this. I don't proclaim to be intelligent, but I certainly have the majority of int",['malignant'],1

Let's see, accusations of parroting, arbitrary classification of users based upon pen-name preferences, straw-men, ignoratio elenchi, and finally begging the question through the same fallacious reasoning as previously. We call that petitio principii, don't we? Apparently nothing will change his mind until I change my pen-name to something like John Doe. How does he know that I am not this Russian dude who likes Iranian history and culture? Oh, that's right, he doesn't. He probably didn't check my IP-address to see that I'm based in Sweden and could in fact be a Swede. Whoops... Sounds like our neutralist is using a subtle profiling method to his convenience.

Like I stated before, it doesn't matter if I'm a Nazi, Communist, Liberal or even a hippie. It doesn't matter if I do drugs, or if I look even remotely like a reptile. It doesn't matter if I'm even an obese Tongan kid. It has no bearing on content or the essentials of an argument, and anything else you might conjure to the favour of some imagined affiliation. This is aptly called speculation.

Now, I will only say two things. First one is a rehearsal of my previous suggestion: Livius.org is visited by thousands of people daily. Along with a number of other scholar-related websites, I can't live without checking it by a daily basis. It deserves a Wiki-article, where Jona Lendering is briefly described as the founder and maintainer of an outlet with roots as far back as -96. Yes, sounds like a plan of revenge. The paragon of Pan-Iranic resurgence! The removal of a Wiki-article of Lendering will remove the last great obstacle to a resurgent Achaemenid empire and the reawakening of the terrifying Persian horsemen of doom! Howl! Howl! Our world is forfeit!

Second point, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart: Get laid. Your superior-inferior complex isn't convincing anyone here, whether they be Iranian or not. There is no chance an article of this quality gets to stay. That's the bottom line, irrespective of any perceived reasoning. Either change the article so that it pertains to Livius.org, or stop your incessant whining. Maybe it never occurred to you that by simple observation Jona Lendering has written several Iran-friendly articles and has generally sought to dispel several popular misconceptions on the ancient Iranians. Maybe that's how you make more drama in your life, by arbitrary holier-than-thou attitude.

Apparently it all came flooding back to him, he was reliving the whole trip! He was yelling out and jumping on his seat like it was a rollercoaster, ducking and diving, shouting 'SHIT! LOOK OUT! GODDAM BATS!' That was fantastic – if he thought we'd captured it, then we must have done it.

Cena = Gets too much shit from people for no reason. He can't control the way he is booked. I just believe they should stop pushing him before everyone hates him way too much or just turn him heel which would work for me.

Batista = Whines too much about his position in the company and should shut his mouth. Fuck him, job him out to JBL. I use to like him but he has main evented more than Cena and is in a better position than he should be just because of Triple H.

Orton = Does whatever the fuck he wants because he is a main star and friends with Triple H. Should have been fired already for smoking pot in front of everyone. If it wasn't for Triple H, he would be jobbing in TNA right now. Fuck him, that son of a bitch does not deserve the spot he has. He is good of the mic but ring skills lack, headlock after headlock.

Triple = Been playing politics for years and deserves to become a jobber for the people he has buried. He tried to keep Booker T and Kurt Angle down. Angle is one of the best wrestlers and if you watch his match with Abyss at Turning Point; which I can give you a link, it is worth the watch trust me; is still doing great things. Booker T deserved a hell of alot more than he did in WWE. I can't stand him and I hope he gets hit by a car.

"Is Deepak the ruler of the world? 

Let me give you people who love this guy/girl Deepak....An idea of what Deepak is like....He must be some really unhappy person......i promoise you this is what it is like in dealing with Deepak. 

I bring up an issue where im asking why an article does not have more info, or about editing an article, or about taking something out of an article. 

And Deepak wont allow me to make edits. 

So I give Deepak examples and information and trying to back up my edits are legit. 

And Deepak ignores my logic and doesnt give me alot of logic as to why my info is not valid then 

So I try to figure out why Deepak is being so strcit. I remind him that i backed up what i said. That i had information that was logical. And why my edits are good. 

And Deepak calls me a troll and insults me and accuses me of being a nazi lover or something

So I answer every insult, every accustation , and every put down that Deepak gives me. And then i remind him of why my edits are valid.

And Deepak ignores most of what i write and continues to call me a troll. Or a nazi lover. Or other insults. 

I then get annoyed and ask Deepak why is he ignoring most of my logic that i write down? Why does he pick and choose what he wants to answer? Why does he not give me logic in return? 

And Deepak wont reply . 

I then ask other users about making edits and asking them about my logic and giving them my reasons as to why my edits are valid. And some answer and some agree and some dont. 

And Deepak all of a sudden starts responding again....with logic? No....with answers? no....with reasoning? no....with information? no....he tells the other users that im a troll and a nazi and pro India then . 

I then answer all of Deepaks insults. I remind him of why i want edits to be made. I give him my information as to why  my edits are valid then. 

And Deepak goes back calling me a troll, and a nazi, and a pro India dude. 

And this kind of stuff goes on and on and on...you get the idea.....he ignores information you give him. He picks and chooses what he wants to answer. And he doesnt even answer the logic you give him sometimes. But he wastes his time in name calling, and insluts, and putting you down then. 

So then after a while i get annoyed. And i remind him how things got this bad between us. I type and type and type and type just like i am now. 

And Deepak ignores most of what i typed. 

Many times i write him these long replies where i answer all his points, where i tell him why its wrong for him to insult me and put me down, and why its wrong for him to ignore the information i have as to why i want to make an edit, or whatever it is im bringing up then.....and no matter how much i write....even if i write these long replies to him then....even if i answer every point he brings up....he usually either ignores most of what i wrote down....or....he picks and chooses what he wants to answer.....or.....he just responds back by calling me a troll, or accusing me of being pro nazi or something, or accusing me of ignoring his points (which is so not true cus i respond to pretty much everything he says then), or accusing me of not understanding what he is telling me, or just accusing me of being pro India then (which I am) or just insulting me, or just name calling me, or just putting me down. 

So then after a while i get so annoyed cus he's this a guy here then with me now, and so i start to call him names. I call him a dictator. I call him the ruler of wikiepdia. And I tell him how he ignores my points. 

And then Deepak tells me how i cant call him names, and how i cant throw mud at him, and how im breaking wikipedia rules

So then I ask him how comes its ok for him to name call me and i cant? How come its ok for him to throw mud at me but I cant then? How come its ok for him to break Wikipedia's rules but I can't then? 

And Deepak has no logical answer....or....he won't respond to those questions that I ask him then . Or he just ignores what i ask him, and goes back to accusing me of being a troll, or acting like im a pro nazi or something then , or just insult's me in general then......

So then I get more annoyed and call him thing's like a dictator, which as you can see here with our history, this is how he acts.....isn't it true?.....he ignores most of my points and picks and chooses what he wants to answer.....sometimes he won't even answer you at all.....and sometime's he just insults you then . So it's logical if get annoyed and call him a dicator right?

Wrong....Deepak then holds it against you that your name calling him...and threaten's to block you, or report you, or he just tel",['malignant'],1

 MY STATEMENT 

AND WHAT IS IT I DID EXACTLY TO BE BANNED?
WILL SOMEBODY PLEASE EXPLAIN?
You are obviously not aware of what is goinf ´g on I am ban for not contributing at all with the talk page!! what ? I am the one who asked for this mediation for more than 2 weeks ago and it was for something else than that and this snowskinner who was asked to bring the arbitration knows it perfectly. And i am the one working out ot bring the two best cosmolog in the world to look at those thesis, ans I am the one who did contributed the most in this affair together with Igor Bogdanov, at the refute of those falsifications of evidencies presented here by ybm and his acolytes.
I was ban because ybm had been ban and couldn't stand it.
But where he was ban 24 hours for insulting repaeatridly people and calling Igor Bogdanov a bastard 3 times and for having on several occassions oversteped the 3RR rule, I was ban 3 x 24 hours for having presented an article who was evaluated by Bidhonene who is a very endeared friend of YBM, for not being so usefull as she wish.
An article containing of course a serie of evidenscies who didn't have been shown before, and who constiture a major block against the conspiratorial arguments of ybm and his gang.
Just as she did it here on my talk page when she deleeted it all, and vnever reinserted it, a precious document proving the ´factual connection between YBM and this Voyer who infatuated this whole affair.
It was YBM who had invited his friend on my talkpage, until he realized that i had an arbitration going on that was about this.
Bishonen blocked me 20 minutes after her protegé had been blocked.
i dont see any of her interventions in this talk page concerning the insults of rjb and ybm, nor concerning their cynical and very empty and longs comments about my mediation on the talk page tonight.
You can read my articles yourself and see how hard I was fighting to make sure that the situation will not degenerate further, and to calm down the spirit.
She didn't make an intervention there to ask rjb and ybm to stop their acction and provocating attitudes, nor accused them for saying nothing nor removed their articles for not improving the talk page, nor contributing with anything on it.
She has already been told to don't interfeer anymore on this talk page because she is unable to differentiate between  her liking and her work as an admi.
She does not follow the rules and do a very destructiv work, using retaliation and arbitrarious judgement all the time, and always something who arranged ybm very much.
She even do revert for him and use her status to commit illegitimate stuff.
The arbitration should have been about this too.
They are using the fact that mediator Nicholas turnbull is out for a week to do their bad deeds.
And this snowsnippers know that what he does is out of hand, and that he should never have done it.
He even insulted Nicholas turnbull.
Easy when people aren't there to defend themselves.
Wiki english is a spot on the face of Wikipédia, admi are behaving like sabotors and vandaliser and encourage riot, and abuse of their knoledge and power to undermine actions made to refrein their wrong doing.

This has to stop.
I asked for a mediation and an arbitration comity for more than two weeks and Sowspinners actions are completely unlegitimate.
He has stollen MY mediation and MY arbitration request.
This don't go and has to be aborted.
I do not recognise the actual arbitration for being legitimate, and thereby ask all to boycot it.

None of the involved administrator can in anyway be part of the arbitration comity or of the arbitration.
It is a close debate and not an arena game.
THis arbitration was supposed to be hold secret, as snowspinner knows very well, and took some very unlucky initiatives from the very beginning.
He is an idiot to have done that, and has no sens of responsability, nor of maturity, and cannot be trusted.
He must be removed as well.
i dont accept what happened tonight. There was absolutly no reasons for me to be blocked and certainly not for 3 days.
If I say fuck! like ybm nothing happen, but if I bring precious evidencies, so I am ban and the evidencies confiscated and destroy yes, and detroyed as they have been alredy here several times.
This is the sign of a totalitarian system, and wiki english has became a totalitarian system, where the judged perform the judgement, and were all proofs are stollen and destroyed and were disturbing people are threaten for their meaning and impert to say more, and blocked away.

I hope that's not the case here.  Go ahead and call that what I just described a conspiracy. I dare you- in fact I double-dog-dare you! It is declassified and admitted and on a participating government website. I'll assume good faith, perhaps it is ignorance of the subject on your parts. It ok, I'm ignorant of a lot of wikipedia editing stuff. Belief in documented past history is the not the same as a belief in some conspiracy theory crap. Based on you comments about me, this is a concept you appear to be having trouble with. Any competent person would understand they are not the same. Is there was one available to you to explain it? I was explained to you repeatedly on this page and on my talk page. You are pretty dense of you don't have it yet.  You will find that my primary sources are 100 times more accurate than anything you'll ever find on about this fringe topic.  I am a subject matter expert on certain aspects of CBW and exposures but not on chem trails but no about to out myself to convince you.  Government declassified primary sources on WP are to be used sparingly. People like you make it difficult to talk about serious subjects. Reasonable people should not be constrained in their edits by pure ignorance unless ignorance is the consensus (TBD).  You are unable to consider ever it which speaks to your credibility.

You’re a putrescent mass, a walking vomit. You are a spineless little worm deserving nothing but the profoundest contempt. You are a jerk, a cad, a weasel. Your life is a monument to stupidity. You are a stench, a revulsion, a big suck on a sour lemon.
You are a bleating foal, a curdled staggering mutant dwarf smeared richly with the effluvia and offal accompanying your alleged birth into this world. An insensate, blinking calf, meaningful to nobody, abandoned by the puke-drooling, giggling beasts who sired you and then killed themselves in recognition of what they had done.
I will never get over the embarrassment of belonging to the same species as you. You are a monster, an ogre, a malformation. I barf at the very thought of you. You have all the appeal of a paper cut. Lepers avoid you. You are vile, worthless, less than nothing. You are a weed, a fungus, the dregs of this earth. And did I mention you smell?
Try to edit your responses of unnecessary material before attempting to impress us with your insight. The evidence that you are a nincompoop will still be available to readers, but they will be able to access it more rapidly.
You snail-skulled little rabbit. Would that a hawk pick you up, drive its beak into your brain, and upon finding it rancid set you loose to fly briefly before spattering the ocean rocks with the frothy pink shame of your ignoble blood. May you choke on the queasy, convulsing nausea of your own trite, foolish beliefs.
You are weary, stale, flat and unprofitable. You are grimy, squalid, nasty and profane. You are foul and disgusting. You’re a fool, an ignoramus. Monkeys look down on you. Even sheep won’t have sex with you. You are unreservedly pathetic, starved for attention, and lost in a land that reality forgot.
And what meaning do you expect your delusional self-important statements of unknowing, inexperienced opinion to have with us? What fantasy do you hold that you would believe that your tiny-fisted tantrums would have more weight than that of a leprous desert rat, spinning rabidly in a circle, waiting for the bite of the snake?
You are a waste of flesh. You have no rhythm. You are ridiculous and obnoxious. You are the moral[size] equivalent of a leech. You are a living emptiness, a meaningless void. You are sour and senile. You are a disease, you puerile one-handed slack-jawed drooling meat slapper.
On a good day you’re a half-wit. You remind me of drool. You are deficient
in all that lends character. You have the personality of wallpaper. You are dank and filthy. You are asinine and benighted. You are the source of all unpleasantness. You spread misery and sorrow wherever you go.
You smarmy lager lout git. You bloody woofter sod. Bugger off, pillock. You grotty wanking oink artless base-court apple-john. You clouted boggish foot-licking twit. You dankish clack-dish plonker. You gormless crook-pated tosser. You churlish boil-brained clotpole ponce. You cockered bum-bailey poofter. You craven dewberry pisshead cockup pratting naff. You gob-kissing gleeking flap-mouthed coxcomb. You dread-bolted
fobbing beef-witted clapper-clawed flirt-gill.
You are a fiend and a coward, and you have bad breath. You are degenerate,
noxious and depraved. I feel debased just for knowing you exist. I despise everything about you, and I wish you would go away.
I cannot believe how incredibly stupid you are. I mean rock-hard stupid.
Dehydrated-rock-hard stupid. Stupid so stupid that it goes way beyond the stupid we know into a whole different dimension of stupid. You are trans-stupid stupid. Meta-stupid. Stupid collapsed on itself so far that even the neutrons have collapsed. Stupid gotten so dense that no intellect can escape. Singularity stupid. Blazing hot mid-day sun on Mercury stupid.
You emit more stupid in one second than our entire galaxy emits in a year. Quasar stupid. Your writing has to be a troll. Nothing in our universe can really be this stupid.

It had been six years since we had graduated from college, and for the first time since graduation, all three of us were together again. From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.

Having returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.

As I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.

The conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.

It felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.

The intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.

No words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.

I awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while Beth and I held each other as she slept.","['malignant', 'rude', 'abuse']",1

Again, I never asserted the Greaseman's death.

Since Neturalhomer chooses to edit his User Talk page to erase the past, I will post the relevant exchange here (he gave """"removing vandalism"""" as the reason for editing it out; his only tool is a hammer, perhaps, so he sees me as a nail, perhaps)

Your Lie(s) About Me

You wrote: """"Final Warning

Saying things like """"DC101 IS HIS FUCKING EMPLOYER!!!"""" and """"Don't be a douche"""" is a good way to get blocked....fast. Tone the language down...and pay attention. Greaseman ain't dead. If you continue, to add continued, now, lies to Wikipedia, I will report you to AIV and to your ISP, Verizon. Stop now, this is your final warning. - NeutralHomer • Talk """"

Yes, I did use the language (on a talk page) and if it will make the booboo feel better, I apologize. But who doesn't enjoy a nice summer's eve?

BUT, you need to STOP LYING about me. I never said the Greaseman was dead, only that his death had been reported by sources considered reliable by Wikipedia standards. A little attention to detail on your part would be much appreciated, Eve. Otherwise, perhaps it is I who shall report you. Tell you what: you admit and retract your lie and I will consider the matter closed. Fair?

Let's look at your odd writing style: """"If you continue, to add continued, now, lies to Wikipedia,"""" Just what are you going for there?

I've never put a lie on Wikipedia, contrary to your assertion. Anyone who lies about me can go screw.

Your threat to report me to my ISP (FOR WHAT, EVE?) is beyond pathetic. Two pops for yes!! Report away.

Now, the admin who blocked me said that more than one reliable source was needed on sensitive matters.  He did not research sufficiently to reach a correct conclusion.

Let's all remember, shall we, that I never said that Greaseman was dead, simply that he was REPORTED DEAD.  There's a big difference, and the fact that it was reported is not in dispute.  I NEVER SAID GREASEMAN WAS DEAD.  Yet Neutralhomer continues to assert that I did.  THAT IS A LIE.  I consider someone lying about me a personal attack, under Wikipedia guidelines.  Is this a """"separate but equal"""" or """"separate and unequal"""" system?

The admin who blocked me wants more than one source that someone said something on the radio.  Let's look at Wikipedia's entry on Cesar Romero's personal life, shall we?  There is NO source cited for his death, nor his homosexuality, yet those are all sensitive topics, are they not?  Why doesn't Neutralhomer report the author of this page for vandalism?

The fact that Neutralhomer claims that dealing with me gave him a migraine on the talk page of the admin who blocked me demonstrates that this is a personally based effort on his part.

To recap: I never lied.  I never vandalized.  That should be enough.

Now let's look at Wikipedia's reckless report of Cesar Romero's death and homosexuality, shall we?  Sensitive matters, no?

Personal life

Romero believed in liberation theology. Romero was very Christian yet still believed in a utopian society whose belief is that Christ's kingdom would be very similar to Marx's envisionment of communism, and held to this belief until his death.[1][2]

Romero always claimed his grandfather on his mother's side was Cuban poet and patriot José Martí, although his mother's parents were legally Carmen and Manuel Mantilla with José Martí as his godfather. There was some speculation that Maria was fathered by Martí who was a boarder in the Mantilla household, but he never claimed Maria as his daughter in his lifetime.

Romero was never married, despite proposing to at least one woman. Romero made regular appearances on the Hollywood social circuit, usually in the company of an attractive actress, and he was almost always described in interviews and articles as a """"confirmed bachelor."""" Romero discussed his homosexuality in a series of interviews with author Boze Hadleigh, with the understanding that they would not be published during his lifetime.

Romero wore a man's tennis bracelet inscribed with his favorite nickname: """"Butch."""" The term was reportedly bestowed on Romero by his one-time dancing partner Joan Crawford, who teased Romero by telling him: """"You're so butch!"""" While Romero's homosexuality was an """"open secret"""" in Hollywood, the movie-going public was unaware of his sexual proclivities and there was never any embarrassing scandal surrounding his male liaisons, which shows the care and finesse with which he conducted his private life for more than 60 years.

Romero was a mainstay of the Hollywood social circuit until his death in 1994. He was interred at Inglewood",['rude'],1

"First of all, I've never been blocked before.

Next, let me be clear: Mr. User:Aboutmovies vandalized an article. Then he argued with and ultimately attacked Pcap, the editor who reverted the vandalism. Then Pcap, presumably out of frustration, asked me for help, as I was the one who had provided most of the original text for that article.  I am not active much anymore on wikipedia, so I mostly just I commiserated on Pcap's talk page. I told him I would not get involved. (Why am I not active? Because there are too many assholes like User:Aboutmovies allowed to run free, making life shitty for everyone.)  

Now Mr. User:Aboutmovies, apparently having too much time on his hands, snoops through my personal communications on Pcap's talk page. And so, after putting his nose where it doesn't belong, he gets his nose out of whack, and comes to my personal talk page, and attacks me. Why? This guy clearly owed Pcap an apology. He could have offered an apology. He could have quietly slunk off with his tail between his legs, and repented in private. No, instead of doing the right, honorable thing, he instead chooses to attack me. (So who is escalating? He is.) So I called him an asshole, which he richly deserves. So then he escalates some more: he gets you to block me.  You were sucked right into his game.  You did not bother to do any due diligence. AT ALL. You should have blocked him, not me.  Once you realized your mistake, which Pcap points out to you above, you could have offered me an apology, turned around, and blocked Aboutmovies instead. Did you bother to do any of these things?

This needed to be clarified since there has been a problem with him inserting subsequent posts ahead of mine, which can be misleading to a reader.

So when I objected to his use again of the word """"fucking"""" he then used it at me two more times, as reflected above. This follows a prior incident a few weeks ago when he used the word """"fucking"""" at me. I repeatedly objected and asked him not to do that. I think he did this again because he knew it would upset me because of how upset I was about the prior incident. 

Also, I have been called by someone else a """"bitch"""" and the words """"cunt"""" and """"cock"""" """"shit"""" have been directed at me on this Talk page.

Hate speech is serious, Mr Malber.  As I recall, your involvement with Wikipedia Review was because you were guilty of hate speech, in that you suggested that """"people with autism should not be allowed to edit Wikipedia"""".  Malber, you are a poor person to comment on such an issue.  You should have been banned from Wikipedia for your comments, yet here you remain, continuing with your hate speech.  You are quite correct that Amorrow engaged in hate speech, although of a lesser variety of the kind used by you.  He was banned, as you were.  You, Malber, were banned for hate speech.  Did you forget this?  Perhaps you forgot this.  The place that is the only place devoted to criticism of Wikipedia is indeed important.  You can disagree with as much of it as you like.  Criticism, by its very nature, is not generally accepted by those who it is critical of.  This does not illegitimise it.  There are many and varied very legitimate criticism.  One such criticism is why a hate-monger such as yourself is not banned from Wikipedia.  Perhaps you are biased in this however.  Perhaps you'd like to argue how you are less of a hate speaker than anyone who has ever posted on Wikipedia Review.  As far as our evidence has proven, you are much worse than the worst on WR.

There is a confusion between the different definitions of heterosexuality.

I think if we reorganize the page like the homosexual page this distinction would be more clear.  For example, it would make clear that reproduction results from heterosexual sex, not from a heterosexual orientation.

Hi. It's from the same user who was changing the images before on similar articles. Not to mention that, both images are good resolutions, contrary to what the user says, which is why I don't see the need to change images, delete galleries and remove content. It's unnecessary.

 A hit list for Jews 
There is a site called Jew Watch out there (I'll let you find the link) which specialises in """"keeping an eye on Jewish activities"""".  It is used as a reference site by anti-semites the world around.  Jew Watch makes it a point to make sure that they do not, under any circumstances, list someone who they cannot confirm 100% is Jewish.  Stormfront, a white supremist web forum, uses Jew Watch all of the time.

The criteria for inclusion on List of British Jews is the same criteria used by Jew Watch.  It is a criteria designed for anti-semites.  It is a criteria that is aimed in hurting Jews.

Jewish communities do not have such a criteria.  They allow anyone to be considered to be a Jew if they have any linkage with the Jewish community, through race, religion or culture.  This is the normal criteria that is used.  If your father is Jewish, then per Jewish community standards, you are Jewish.  And so forth.

Wikipedia as a whole has certain criteria for verifiability.  But these criteria are not being applied to this list.  This is being changed purely because this is a Jewish list.  Whilst Slim Virgin and her friends have claimed that this is in order to stop muslim terrorists, this is plainly not true.  If we are worried about terrorists strapping bombs to their bodies and blowing up Jews, then this list shouldn't exist at all.  And we should especially not try to focus on who are the """"real Jews"""".  Wikipedia are changing their rules, purely to push an anti-semetic point of view.  And while Slim Virgin goes around claiming that others who oppose her are neo-nazis, and ignoring their strong ties to the Jewish community, she herself has been unable to answer the questions about her own religious hatred.  And this is the same person who has supported muslim POV pushers, who have written vehement anti-semetic text throughout Wikipedia.  Slim Virgin has been a catalyst for banning people who have opposed these islamofascists.  Slim Virgin is an anti-semite.

Right now, I would encourage deletion of this list.  It is being run by anti-semites and used to harm all Jewish people.  Until such time as Slim Virgin can be banned from editing this and related pages, it is dangerous to continue to have such a page.  It is encouraging hatred of Jews.""",['loathe'],1

That is absolutely false.
You posted a """"civility warning"""" in my talk page.
That was the only time that you posted there, ever, for this issue.
My reaction to that, was to come here to ask what happened.
We discussed it here, and when the discussion ended, without any result, I removed the civility warning from my talk page, because I use to archive / remove old conversations in my talk page.
Automatically, wen you saw I had removed the civility warning, you blocked me for a 24 hour period.
Your block was absolutely illegitimate, for various reasons:
The way you did it:
The reason you gave to block me was: """"Yes, I've seen the comment on your talk page. This was the combination of mine and his responses to your previous question."""". And few minutes later, you posted """"24 hour block issued"""".
All this information was posted in your own talk page, and talking to another user.
You did not communicate to me that you had blocked me. I did not see that you had blocked me until, few days later the block had expired, I came to your talk page, and saw that you had said that you had blocked me.
In addition, by not communicating me that I was blocked, you did not allow me to ask other admins to review my block.
The reasons why you did it:
It is not stated anywhere in this Wikipedia that an user cannot remove stuff from his talk page.
You neither told me not to remove that stuff.
I accepted and fulfilled your request of having a civil attitude. Ignoring what I had done before (which was not much), since the moment you told me that, I kept a civil attitude.
I also lost my time coming here to reply you, so there is no possible way to say that I ignored your request.
In all, your block was just full of irregularities. It was not a normal admin block, but rather a thoughtless decission that you took without following any kind of procedure. You just decided that I had to be blocked because you might think that removing the civility warning that you had posted in my talk page was some kind of lack of respect towards you. But it is frankly stupid to think that way, because of the reasons I've explained above.
And since you realized that you had comitted an enormous mistake, that you had used your admin powers despotically, you just repeatedly ignored the requests that I did to you in your own talk page, where I asked you why had you blocked me (this one, and this one), adding to your unjustified attitude towards me, a high grade of arrogance.
In addition, you are threatening me. Read well what I wrote:
""""Hello? Why did you block me? Since when removing a civility warning from one's talk page is something that deserves a block? You did not even communicate my block to my talk page. I am stil waiting for a justification of your abusive attitude as admin. You not only block for no reason but you also ignore people's requests of justification!"""".
Where do you see a lack of respect here? Where do you see that I """"keep"""" an uncivil attitude? Honestly, you are the one being uncivil: """"if you carry on in the line you are takng, you will be blocked again"""" ... which line I am takng? And why do you threaten me? """"If you do not wish to contribute constructively to the encyclopedia, then we shall make sure that you do not prevent others from contributing"""" ... oh, """"we"""". This sounds to me more like a street gang threatening a poor pedestrian, than an admin giving wise advices to a poor Wikipedian. Go to my user page and see the articles I've created. Isn't that a positive contribution?
Look: I am not being uncivil; it is you, the one being disrespectful with me. And I am not ignoring your requests of being civil; I am fulfilling them. And it is rather you, who are not only ignoring my requests of justification for the actions you carried out against me, but also threatening me with new repressive measures.  """,['malignant'],1

 The Truth About Me, Stephen 

Hello, you sexy little love-hole!
I am seeking hot, kinky sex; that is why I am here.  I am seeking a large, hairy, ape-like man to discipline me.  I like it when big men talk dirty to me whilst pounding their rock-hard schingslongs into my mangina; just thinking about it makes my tiny little micro-penis perk up like Hitler on meth. I want a big, strong man to beat me up whilst another muscular hunk restrains me and whispers obscenities into my innocent little ear.  I especially like it when I am called 'a cum-guzzling, dick-sucking, fellating, felching, shit-sniffing, nigger-worshipping, homosexual man-slut,' for I know, in my heart, that this description of me is extremely accurate.  Please, big, hairy men, I want to be your ass-slave, serving you and satisfying you with my bunghole for as long as my submissive soul remains in this world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1111one1111won11  I will even pay you large sums of money if that is necessary.

 Adult-child sex & child sexual abuse 

Copied from WP:ANI ohio 

 I've asked this question before, but I've never had an understandable explanation:  How is the article a POV fork?  If it's been explained previously, just point me to the diff.  I've seen plenty of people say it's a POV fork, but what I see is a value-neutral etic approach to a topic that's as old as humanity itself.  Even if the title is POV, the content can be used in other articles, so why delete it? ohio 

 """"Adult-child sex"""" is a euphemism (for child sexual abuse), and any article titled """"Adult-child sex"""" is prima facie assumed to be apologistic for child sexual abuse. Exactly as if someone took an article """"Nazi genocide"""" and retitled (or made a fork) entitled """"Nazi demographic adjustments"""". We understand that you don't agree with this but if you still don't understand it then you had better look to yourself.   

 Exactly as Hero said. As a contemporary example, Ethnic Cleansing and Genocide. One is just a fancy name for the other.  •   •  • 03:41 (UTC)  6 Mar '08

I don't see the logic of that.  Adult-child sex (the term) goes no further than plain description.  I can see where some editors were trying to insert POV material about child sexual abuse into the article, but I don't see how it logically follows that the term itself becomes a euphemism for child sexual abuse.  The term itself can advance no agenda.  It is materially different from the genocide = demographic adjustments example, which may invoke Godwin's law.  As for VP's example, ethnic cleansing means something different from (but related to) genocide, just as adult-child sex does with child sexual abuse.  The repeated assertion has been made that the term itself is POV.  Where is the POV in it?  Since this seems not to be much of an AN/I question, I invite replies at my talk page. ohio """,['malignant'],1

So far and far, Harry the Dirty Dog  this user is doing vandalism and it seems he is not allowing for us to remove the non-reliable sources and references. 
Also this user seems to have a personal agenda to secure this as far as possible, and seems to me, this user Harry the Dirty Dog  is on a personal agenda of defaming this lady. There is no proof and this is a rumour according to me and is supposed to be dismissed. If any one needs to research then one must google up and find out what she is up to!

This whole conversation is rediculous as the colors on a flag are meant to represent different ideas or ideals. What we decide to call that color has everything to do with what is meant by that color. By calling it yellow one is neglecting to fully appreciate the meaning behind the choice of gold as a flag color is meant to convey an idea, that of eternal and original wealth and prosperity. It has nothing to do with being high and mighty regarding the naming of a color. That is a reactionary and frankly stupid position to hold. Flags are symbols meant to illustrate various ideas and they use images and colors, like all other forms of symbolism, to do this. Thus, the use of gold on a flag is in no way an attempt to sound more high and mighty, but rather a way to communicate.... you dolt",['malignant'],1

It had been six years since we had graduated from college, and for the first time since graduation, all three of us were together again. From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.

Having returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.

As I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.

The conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.

It felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.

The intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.

No words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.

I awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while Beth and I held each other as sh","['malignant', 'rude', 'abuse']",1

 Geez Hesp, as well as being a coward you are a little paranoid, sorry very paranoid, you should also call your Mummy and Daddy. 
In case you are stupid as well as paranoid and a coward, speaking face to face is the old fashoined way of sorting out problems as opposed to hiding behind a pretty name in a cyber veil; you pathetic little excuse for a man.   —Preceding unsigned comment added by Gregjay (talk • contribs)

 you are obviously a bigoted racist, as you have not removed the page for Gordon (name) which is an article about a name. Yet you are removing articles about names of people from a nation you clearly have something against.

 But it does not surprise me, at all. Most people who deal with IT are of a limited intellectual capacity, especially when it copmes to evaluating their own shortcomings (cf. http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/kateconnolly/3637231/Are_you_a_Fachidiot/ ), and even more so when they have not actually graduated from a university but are self-taugt like you appear to be.

 In any case, your blatant Serbophobia in removing start up articles about the names of a culture that you disparage is a disgrace to Wikipedia in English.

 BTW, I deleted the nonsense you posted on my talk page. Do not do that ever again. It is unwanted and unacceptable. I will not be posting here any more either, and I will report you to Meta Wiki as a racist unfit to work on the site.",['malignant'],1

"CLIMATE? PLEASE! 

What IDIOT suggested Russell, Kansas has a humid subtropical climate? There is no way in hell Russell, Kansas could be classified as humid subtropical. It is either humid continental or semi-arid steppe, and I would lean toward the latter, since this part of Kansas is not nearly as humid and does not receive near the rainfall as the eastern half of the state. If Kansas Citywhich is at the same latitude as Russellis classified as humid continental, there is no earthly reason why Russell, which is nearly five derees farther WEST in longitude can be humid subtropical.","['malignant', 'abuse']",1

 Reply to """"On gender"""" 

Your posted: Don't guess at someone's gender, as you have done here.  It is uncivil, and could in fact be taken as insult.  Any argument you might have that their 'name appears to be that of a female/woman' is invalid, as you have no idea if that is their name, last name, middle name.. etc.  It could even be a reference to the male comicbook character Blade, who had the name of Daywalker given to him by others in the comic book.— dαlus Contribs 

If you know your friend’s gender, spit it out, you stupid ass. Your entire posting, if you didn’t have the agenda I ascribe to you, infra, would have been “FYI: He/she is a female/male” and I would adjust accordingly. Hell, if you tell me that Dayewalker is a consortium, and I’d refer to Dayewalker as “they/it.” Don’t continue to be an ass if you post further, or understand that your further postings are unworthy of reply.

I note that you are not correcting your friend Dayewalker when she posts to you 6 days ago """"I saw that afterwards, I knew HE was topic banned but it had slipped my mind about the overall bannation. Thanks! Dayewalker (talk) 06:48, 13 July 2010."""" Are suggesting that you know that Dayewalker has completed genetic testing on the subject of her comment, so that he (Dayewalker) is not guessing at ‘his” gender (the subject of her (Dayewalker’s) comment) when he only refers to """"he’;"""" or that he (Dayewalker) has genetic evidence that the """"he"""" is actually a """"she"""" and she (Dayewalker) is insulting them by suggesting that the """"he"""" is too ballsy or pushy to be a woman/“lady.” Dayewalker is not whining about this unintended insult of either referring to a woman as “she” or equally unintended insult of referring to a man as “she.” Don't be an ass.

If Dayewalker, or anyone, is so concerned about their gender identification, and they are not an idiot, they will use a prefix like """"Mr."""" or """"Ms."""" Dayewalker has not said anything about it and it is off topic to the discussion. If you wish to join into the discussion, please feel free. On second thought, don’t join in. I have no confidence that you would answer the questions posed by the other editor either. Dayewalker (he she, they, etc.) doesn’t answer his question. Ut oh, now I’ve called Chowbok a “he.” No doubt her boyfriend/girlfriend will rush in to call me a “beast” and start a fight on the 2nd grade playground. If Dayewalker thinks that he has been called a """"sissy"""" or a """"girlie,"""" then she can address that with me. He doesn't need a mighty protector to create issues designed to get me banned. And by """"protector,"""" I mean you. You are an ass. Male. Female. Both. Neither. And of whatever ‘sexual orientation,” if any, that you wish to use to identify yourself, or not identify yourself, or feel the need to identify yourself, or feel the need to keep private, or over which you do not care.

You are continuing to misrepresent my original objection.  My objection was NOT that 'he didn't respond in 8 hours', or anything like that.  (You portrayed that as my objection, though!).  Instead, I objected that Dodo wasn't addressing MY ACTUAL OBJECTIONS.  Other than his 'driveby deletions', and a template or two, he DIDN'T respond to my complaints.  Not only  did he not address my objections within a day (as you implied my original complaint was), he didn't even EVENTUALLY address my objections!  Irresponsibly, and probably maliciously, you tried to make me look like 'the bad guy' for objecting to Dodo's repeated rapid deletions without waiting for consensus, etc.
Dodo was trying to act on the theory, 'if somebody does ANYTHING even arguably criticizable, I can slap him down repeatedly by deleting his edits, without waiting for any sort of consensus, etc.'  (Evidently, that is your position as well.)  I say, """"No!"""".  Dodo never, in detail, responded to my repeated and DETAILED complaints of his behavior.  Is the reason that 'he is busy'?  Well, if he's SO BUSY, 
why did he have enough time to repeatedly delete my posts?  Doesn't make sense, does it?  The answer is quite simple:  Dodo (and, I suspect, many other self-appointed 'Info-Nazi's' ALWAYS have time to slap down other users (that's EASY, and takes little time!), but they DON'T have enough time to actually defend their own actions when challenged!  Dodo (and many others) amount to semi-professional BUSYBODIES who strut their stuff by interfering with others' use of WP.  Stop it.

no seriousy.  the only thing i think actually did or said against your precious wikipedia policies was saying that """"if i really had my way, half of you would be shot"""".  ignoring for a while the fact that i was obviously joking, it happens to be my religious belief that the human race on a whole would be much, much better off if 95% of the population died tomorrow.  that doesn't mean i go around killing people, or making specific death threats against individuals.  and don't you actually have the sense to realize that if someone says """"OH MY GOD YOU ARE SUCH A FUCKING IDIOT, JUST GO DIE ALREADY"""" that they probably don't want you to die, or more accurately they don't care.  Very few people actually have the emotion required to sit and pray for the death of another person or group of people.  And I am not one of those people.

If you really wanted to show off what a horrible and insensitive person I am,  edit, which was on a wiki talk page, is probably not the best.  Granted, nothing pisses me off more than people who see letters like я and щ and automatically assume that whatever is written is Russian.  The Cyrillic alphabet is used in many Slavic languages, as well as central asian former soviet republics, and even Mongolia.  So I called someone an idiot.  BOO FUCKING HOO.  maybe he could have said """"What language is that?"""" instead of assuming that it was Russian.  However insulted he was by me calling him an idiot, I can guarantee you that I was at least 10 times as insulted by him calling that Russian.  I am a proud, native Russian, and will not have my culture besmirched with these allegations.

Your other example how I am a bad contributor is what, a spelling correction?  Or was it the fact that my edit summary was how I felt about the sad fact that niggers can't spell? Don't even think about raising issue of my use of the word.  I live in Harlem.  Around here, that word is used like a comma.  And before you try to tell me the difference between """"nigga"""" and """"nigger"""", there is none.  It's called a dialect.  While for some purposes, it makes sense to write things phonetically as they are pronounced by the person saying them, I find it is usually clearer to spell properly.  Also, a nigger, to me at least, is not a """"black person"""". I am not a racist. I do not even draw distinctions between people. In my holy opinion, there is a nigger inside of all of us.  People (like you, for instance) who take offense for no reason (i mean, was saying """"black people are stupid and i think they should be marginalized in society, tarred and feathered, strung up on trees, dragged through town by their enormous wangs, etc.""""?  No.  And if that is what you heard, I'd like to know why.  Are you black?  98% of the black people I know personally use the word """"nigger"""" more than I do.) are why we as a society still can't get over the silly idea that words are harmful.  Words are not harmful.  Ideas are harmful.  One particularly harmful idea is that certain words are so unspeakably horrible that nobody can be allowed to say them for any reason at all.  You want to end racism forever?  Stop freaking the fuck out every time you see the word """"nigger"""".  SERIOUSLY.  I happen to be a Priest (and a Docktor), and saving humanity is just one of my many responsibilities.  Fucks like you make me hate it, but I still do it.  That's what a good person I am.

I forgot what else I was going to complain about.  I mean, I could complain about everything on Wikipedia, not because I am uncivil, but because there are enough Wikipedos to make this community unbearable for normal, well-adjusted individuals such as myself.  If you look at all my page edits, they were all GOOD FOR THE ENCYCLOPEDIA.  Ok, there was one tiny exception - a long time ago, I saw someone changed a caption on Scottish fold to """"Winston Churchill"""".  Someone else reverted it, and I reverted it back.  I felt it was an appropriate caption to that particular image.  But everything else was beneficial to improving the quality of the content.  I may be a little hard on people who are hung up on things that are wrong, but I only do what is right.  That is why I put it on my user page.  I don't do wrong things.  If you try to argue with me, you will be in for a world of hurt.  Butthurt, to be exact.  But you have nobody to blame but yourself.  Unlike you, I actually warn people first.  But no.

{{unblock|DISCLAIMER: I do not identify as a Nazi, Neo-Nazi, Facist, Neo-Fascist. I do not accept or agree with the actions or views of Hitler or any other dictators in the world for that matter. I do not hate Jews... in fact I have many jewish friends...
Hello, although this is technically an unblock appeal, it is really only a reason to explain.... you won't be in a mood to unblock me when I'm finished talking... )
First of all I want to apologise, I should have thought before putting the giant swastika on my page. This is the reason for that... I have a few Jewish friends, and normally we sometimes make jokes about jews and christians and things like that. I never really make jokes about the holocaust, because that never go over well with them and it is not nice... well, apparently, a joke about jews being lawyers set one of my closest friends off who is not really a jew, but claims he is.... now he thinks I am a facist, nazi, and I hate jews.... i gotreally frustrated and annoyed and so I came home and started messing around on my userpage... Second of all, i would like to ask why it is not permissable to """"self identify as a nazi""""? There are several userboxes dealing with this subject. There is even a userbox that states, """"This user identifies as a Hitlerist! WHAT THE HELL?!?!?! You will let people say they support Hitler, but you won't let them say they are nazis?!? Being a nazi does not mean that you condone Hitler or his actions, it simple means that you support the theory of the politics behind Nazism.... you can be a nazi and not support the horrible eugenics policy. But if you are hitlerist, that obviously says you support all that... your arguement would of course be that it is offensive to jews.... well if you are taking that into account, then you should also ban anyone that says they identify as a communist. That can be extremely offensive to christians... if you want me to, I can talk about all the horrible things they did to christians in communist russia (with reference of a nice book). I think I will... one of the things they did was putting shackles on the ankles and wrists of christians with spikes of the inside that cut into your skin if you moved at all... and then they put starved rats into your cell that tried to eat you alive so you had to fight them off while your wrists and ankles are killing you. They also tied you to a cross and hung you upside down over a huge pile of other prisoners crammed into a small room. You were then forced to excrete over everyone. You were also stood upright in a box while they drove long nails into it. It was alright if you stood perfectly still, but you would have to stand there for hours and then your body would sway and poke into the nails. They also stood you naked in a freezer with a doctor nearby that signalled when you were freezing to death and then they would take you out and warm you up. They would do that for hours on end. Then they would beat you over and over again asking you to renounce Christ... the holocaust was horrible, but I would rather be gassed or hung by a nazi than endure those tortures for 18 years like one man who wrote a book about his experiences... so could you ban all communists please? 
My last comment is in response to Chzz's question about me making the 'gay comment' statement. Nowadays the word gay is used for two meanings... one is homosexuality and the other is wierd, stupid, dumb... i was using the second connotation.... maybe if you people didn't spend so much time on this gay... sorry... stupid online encyclopedia you would realize how the real world uses words...
Even if you unblock me (which you won't... )...) I will take a wikibreak... i don't want to become addicted to point of ruining my social life...... i have already recieved a punishment, never becoming an admin (the whole gay... sorry... dumb trust thing)... just know this... i would have enventually removed the swastika after I cooled down and because of your gay... sorry... dumb policy you have lost a serious editor... this whole thing has really annoyed me...
  
(P.S. Chzz, I have been on Wikipedia for 2 years... you think I forgot to sign my gay... sorry... stupid post? yeah right!)

"In defence of China! 

Hey Koreans, who the fuck do you think you're dealing with. Guess what, Gaogouli was a Chinese vassal you stupid fucks. After the fall of the Tang Dynasty, close to 700,000 were incorporated into Tang history, a little less than half migrated to the Central Plains, 100,000 to the Chinese state of Bohai and only 100,000 into Xinluo (Silla). Most Gaogouli descendants are Chinese.

With the sole exception of Ansi fort itself, Tang troops destroyed Gaogouli soldiers on the battlefield, despite being a significantly smaller force. If anything, Gaogouli only DEFENDED itself from assaults from Sui and Tang. Gaogouli was a mere Chinese vassal, nothing more. The greatest threat came from the TuBo, TuJue and HuiHe from the west. Koreans are a bunch of fucking attention whores.

You fucking barbarian kimchi gooks have a lot of nerve to badmouth your former masters, considering the fact that you were our little dog for most of your existance. Not to mention your stupid kings would submit to the Imperial envoy in the direction of the Great Emperor of China. Fucking barbarian gooks got a lot of nerve to mess with us. We are the descendants of the great Yellow Emperor and the inheritors of the Great Han and Tang Dynasties. Stupid barbarian shit, don't piss us off.","['malignant', 'rude', 'abuse', 'loathe']",1
