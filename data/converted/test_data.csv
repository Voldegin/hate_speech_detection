 Differentiating the deposement from the coup

They lost every battle  with foreigners they ever fought, placed themselves under Byzantine suzerainty amd were saved from extinction by Croats who crushed Bulgarian aggression

3. there are historical documents galore, which testify about Croatian legal, parliamentary and cultural continuity: from the times of Trpimir and Krešimir to the later corpora.

4. Croatian language heritage in the vernacular is well attested in from the 13th century on (at least). They Croatian name is explicitly mentioned in various sources, both Čakavian and Štokavian, particularly in Dalmatia, Dubrovnik and Bosnia. Moreover, linguistic characteristics are the same as with contemporary (mid-19th century) Croatian language. On the other hand, Serbian written works, up until Dositej and Vuk (1780-1820), were written exclusively in Church Slavic language. Serbian literature until Vuk is, essentially, a variant of Church Slavic literature flourishing in Byzantium influenced area. Hence-Vuk's linguistic pan-Serbism, which tried to appropriate all štokavian vernacular literature is, evidently, a falsity and concoction.

5. early Slavic studies (Šarařik et al.) were deluded in ascribing parts of the Croatian literature to the Serbian heritage.

6. Serbian ethnic affiliation, in modern terms, is a relatively new phenomenon in Croatia. The major part of Eastern Orthodox inhabitants of Croatia, who actively participated in the Croatian cultural life (Illyrian movemont) have begun to show Serbian national allegiance only in recent (1850s) years. 

Virtually all Starčević's claims are corroborated by historical sources available at his times. Whether the veracity of historical sources like the DAI can withstand the test of time-this is another question. But, from the vantage point of mid-19th century clash of Serbian and Croatian ideologies, Starčević polemic stands as an example of skilled, sometimes sardonic and always truthful debate-without distortions, lies or misappropriations. Sarcasm hurts-but, this is what the polemic is all about.

 Re-Listing of evidence that Safavids were Turkic speakers 
Tajik, since you have ignored the numerous references which we bring, and constantly are trying to purge out the word Turkic from Safavid page, let me bring you some more summarized quotes. Many of these may be already on this talk page, it's just some people choose to ignore them and uphold their own POV:

 The establishment of the Gajar capital in Tehran at the end of the eighteenth century was merely the last manifestation of what may well be a permanent tendency in the life of Iran. There are manifold reason of this phenomenon. Moreover, the Turkish and Mongol origins of the earliest dynasties certainly played a major part in causing the capitals to be situated in the north, and especially along the main invasion route following Alburz into Azarbaijan. The princes of these basically nomadic states were anxious both to be near their tribes and to avoid the excessive heat of the climate farther to the south. This helps to explain the evolution of Tabriz, which, despite all the vicissitudes, was the capital successively of the Mongols, the Qara Qoyunlu, the Aq Qoyunlu, and finally the Safavids, all of whom stemmed originally from the Turkmen tribes of the north-west from the thirteenth to the sixteenth centuries. Tabriz was abandoned only for short periods, and always for other cities in the same region: Maragheh, whose, fertile pasture land had attracted Hulagu, Ardabil, the cradle of the Safavids; and Sultaniyeh.

 The Cambridge History of Iran (in eight Volumes). Volume 1. The Land of Iran. Edited by W.B.Fisher, Cambridge at the University Press, 1968. Page 434. 

 The origins of the Safavids are clouded in obscurity. They may have been of Kurdish origin (see R. Savory, Iran Under the Safavids, 1980, p. 2; R. Matthee, """"Safavid Dynasty"""" at iranica.com ), but for all practical purposes they were Turkish-speaking and Turkified. Their eponymous ancestor, Safi-al-Din (1252-1334), was a disciple of Shaikh Zahed of Gilan, a Sunnite Sufi pir or spiritual leader. Safi-al-Din succeeded his pir and settled in Ardabil in eastern Azerbaijan, and founded the Safavid Order. He was buried there, and his tomb and the citybecame a place of pilgrimage for his devotees. In the course of time and under the leadership of Safi-al-Din's descendents, the order became a militant Shiite one, with golat or extremist features, receiving support from Turkish and Turkmen tribes in Azerbaijan and eastern Anatolia, such as the Shamlu, Ostajlu, Takallu, D¨u'l-Qadr, Qajar, and Afshar tribes, who had strong devotional ties to the heads of the Order. 

 The oldest poet of Azeri literature known so far (and indubitably of Azeri, not East Anatolian or Khorasani, origin) is Emad-al-din Nasimi (about 1369 – 1404, q.v.). Other important Azeri poets were Shah Esma'il Safawi """"Khata'i"""" (1487 – 1524) and Fozuli (about 1494 – 1556,q.v.), an outstanding Azeri poet. During 17th – 20th centuries a rich Azeri literature continued to flourish, but classical Persian exercised great influence on the language and literary expression. On the other hand, many Azeri words (about 1.200) entered Persian (still more in Kurdish), since Iran was governed mostly by Azeri-speaking rulers and soldiers since 16th century (Doerfer, 1963-75); these loanwords refer mainly to administration, titles and conduct of war.  

 Shah Abbas II (r. 1052 – 77/ 1642 – 66 q.v.) was himself a poet, writing Turkic verse with the pen name of Tani.  

 The Zands were an Iranian people, and their decades of dominance were one of the few periods, between the arrival of the Saljūqs and the twentieth century, during which effective political power was exercised by a dynasty that can be regarded as in some sense ethnically """"Persian"""". 

 David Morgan. Medieval Persia, 1040-1797 (History of the Near East) ISBN: 0582493242

 With the exception of some very local dynasties, the Zands were the only Iranian dynasty that had come to power since the Buyids in the 10th century. 

 The Azeri Turks are Shiites and were founders of the Safavid dynasty.

[url]http://www.romanoimpero.com/2010/01/pompei.html[/url]

He routes it to the usual that it was a leopard, but the leopard mosaic is in the house of doves, the lion standing over a prostrated tiger is in the house of faun. Several members point out his major flaws such as Bbbeto, as he states its not that the sources arnt reliable he just doesnt want anything that favors the lion and will show the lion as the usual winner, its not that they arent peer jorunals, its that the support the lion, he has erased over 20 things not seeable now on the talk page and edit page, it doesnt matter if its from a trainer, if they support the lion he will call it unreliable and the rules dont apply...what rules? Its only his rules, there hasnt been a consensus done by 10 people at once going on over 6 years? Is this what wiki is for, for who ever is the more persistent and the better liar to be able to control wiki?

Show us just one of them, name the university, show us who you studied under, show us a copy of your diploma, he is a pathological liar, look under the bear contributions countless of people call him specifically a tiger fan, look at the talk page there, the lion vs tiger contribution, only he is ever erasing things of favoring the lion, Wikipedia mods should be ashamed for having a person use its search engine for a person pumping out his own propaganda and bias POV for this amount of time unchecked. He now says that no experts favor a lion, really? Define expert, if we look at what wiki has as expert:
[url]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert[/url]

We can see that an expert is someone who has pro-longed experience or observation, the topic is about them fighting, so they have to have excerpts and citations of them seeing a fight...no excerpts of them exist for the tiger so far, yet he disputes people who does, and is considered experts.

"Hi Elen, apart from chewing your ear for the first deletion tag I have generally seen your own actions as even handed and I would extend this comment to a few of the other editors, all who disagreed with my view but after seeing how Wikipedia works internally I confess to being little else than disgusted at the sheer stupidity involved and I point that criticism at the mechanics of the successful removal of the page stub for JWASM I bothered to write for Wikipedia. The same antagonist tried to trash the MASM page that I rewrote earlier and from his comments in its talk page it is only a matter of time until he does it again. An earlier editor tried to get some content into the MASM page by scouring the MASM32 web site and linking to web pages that I wrote for the masm32 user base and while I was willing to tolerate this and did a reasonable amount of work on the MASM page to try and get it up to date and relevant so it was no longer needed, in the face of endless obstruction I will simply resolve the problem from outside Wikipedia. You are correct in the idea of taking the bat home but it goes further, pulling the stumps and taking the ball and stumps as well then ploughing the field and leaving the mess for the antagonist to clean up.

If their is some fundamental law of nature saying they aren't mercs, then why include them in the article on mercenaries at all? (Anymore than a section in the Birds article called Dogs are not birds). 
Presumably it is included because there is some sort of controversy, and as written it seems very POV.

But, anyway, a pescetarian is a type of vegetarian, as valid sources state. The lead does not directly call pescetarians vegetarians (due to dispute), but only presents that, in some authoritive dictionaries, vegetarianism may include the consumption of fish. As stated before, the lead then makes sure to tie that type of diet to pescetarianism, and note how pescetarianism being thought of as vegetarianism is disputed. Merriam-Webster even now defines pescetarianism  as """"vegetarians who eat fish"""" (as I've already mentioned)...so, clearly, there is validity in mentioning pescetarianism as being an aspect of vegetarianism (as much as veganism is), especially as long we note the dispute between the two terms, and especially when pescetarianism is present within the body of this article, below the lead.

The same sort of hypocrisy was current in matters of religion.

And how conveniently, after it was the IP that threatened me of admin actions jjust a few hours ago, it's actually Buspar that is coming to complain to an admin, and we're not hearing from the IP...As if the 2 persons were one and the same !

I find it strange that Buspar is so familiar with what the IP did only a few hours ago, and rushed to complain here, while he has not been contacted by the IP.

As if, by magic, he read every article that the IP has edited. Please Jehochman, explain me how could all this be possible without Buspar being the IP ? 

Anyway, it's Buspar that is harassing me. He's systematically tracking down every single one of my edits in articles about illegal fan translations and distributions of copyrighted material, so that he could rush to revert them and provoke me at the same time, then threatening to complain to admins. 

Then, saying edit warring under his username wouldn't work, he's started using anonymous IPs so that his reverts would go unnoticed among the other edits. Then he has used his IPs to try to game a consensus discussion, pretending there was various people against me while it was only him against me.

Let me be clear, there has already been a Sockpuppet check on Buspar. The admin that was in charge of the case never denied that Buspar could be the IPs. Instead, the admin stated, and I quote, """"Looking at contribs, User:Buspar and User:Xuanwu are very probably the same user [...] User:Buspar's userpage clearly states """"I've been editing Wiki off and on with various user names since 2003. I don't like sticking with a user name too long, because I've found that people start reacting to the user name more than the quality of the edits after a bit."""" """"

As I've said, """"the admin never denied or confirmed that """"Buspar"""" wasn't using the IPs listed as aliases. However, anyone that had to deal with you concerning articles will spot you right away. Strangely, 130.49.157.75 and Buspar both appear to be very active on the very same articles: Ron Paul presidential campaign, 2008, Okashina Okashi - Strange Candy, Signum (Nanoha). Also, both of them seem to have a tendency of being involved in heated debates with me concerning illegal fan translations and distributions of copyrighted material. Strangely, both users' interventions in these cases tended to add pov statements in favor of illegal downloading while I tried to prevent this, as it was an obvious violations of policies.""""

And I'm again stating that if he's Buspar, then calling him by one of his username is not an offence. It would be if he wasn't Buspar, but this remain to be proved.  

The only thing is that I don't like him using an anonymous IP when he's reverting my contributions, because I like honesty, and hiding under anonymity when attacking me is never a sign of good faith. I'm only reestablishing his identity, which, if he's Buspar, cannot be an attack in any way. You'll note that I'm not going after every edit of the IP in order to call it Buspar (however he's always there as soon as I edit an article like """"fansub"""", """"fandub"""", """"scanlation""""...), I'm merely reacting when he's targetting my edits. 

I realize, however, that I might not have chosen the best way to deal with the matter. So to calm things down, I offer to stop calling him Buspar if that's what he'd like, under the condition that either him or an admin acknowledge that Buspar and the IP are indeed linked.  """,[],0

I added the sentence with cadaver to the article back in May 2006, one of the advantages of using the word cadaver was that as a summary of a source I used it removed any possibility that it was [[wp:plagiarism|plagiarism], and another advantage is it is accurate.

Yep, this is going to end with at least a partial ban off the site.  After reading Wikipedia:Banning Policy, it now appears that the minimum which may avoid a full-site ban (which I'll address in a second) is at least one WP:TBAN for all professional wrestling posts (with a second WP:TBAN for college football soon to follow) under the """"Community"""" rules stated therein, and at least two WP:IBANs against both Ruth-2013 and ChristianandJericho (or however he spells it).

And that's the minimum...  Quoting from the Banning Policy page:

The measure of a site ban is that even if the editor were to make good edits, permitting them to re-join the community poses enough risk of disruption, issues, or harm, that they may not edit at all, even if the edits seem good.

And that's basically where I fear we are.  I will not be accepted by the consensus.  I knew that going in, and my experience here indicates that I am right in that regard.

 User Narking 2 

Ok, so I see he has made many lies. 
1. The Encyclopaedia of Ukraine is the best source for Ukraine on the English language.
2. It is written by Ukrainians. 
3. The figure I provided IS the most """"mainstream view"""" of Ukrainians, since it stands in the Ukrainian encyclopaedia.. Also, the Ukrainian article of the battle of Poltava supports my view, both in Swedish Casualties AND Swedish strength. 
4. The Swedish Historian's figures are the mainstream among Swedish historians. 
5. Russian imperial figures ARE NOT Soviet figures. The Figueres in the Soviet encyclopaedia are historic estimates as well. Also, the Soviet encyclopaedia is underestimated. Many Swedes think it is just a book of lies, but it is actually a valuable source, and is frequently used to determine casualties in wiki articles, particularly Russian (like in the siege of Sevastopol).   
6. The cute thing now is, that Narking tries to turn ME as the bad guy. All I did was write the Ukrainian POW, and he removed it, arrogantly stating: """"Stop confusing the reader!"""". This is how the entire arguments started.
7. The battle of Grengam article is only a mess in his head. Look at it admin, please. I also see that it has been changed into an even better one, after the editing of another user. 
8. I request that the user Narking is banned from editing Battle of Poltava and Battle of Grengam if he continues with his annoying, and vandalizing edits. 

Umm, one word. PROOF. Until you actually have any sort of backing (at ALL), your argument is empty air. And why is not the Ukrainian view allowed?

 Facts 

I think I'm finally starting to get the hang of this Finding of Fact malarkey, Brad.

The scenario: Bishonen has been focusing her energies for the last few weeks on her attempt to get an editor called Nina Green banned from Wikipedia. When Bishonen realises that Nina Green is indeed going to be banned

She posts to the arbcom page in green text: FoF perfectly normal. Arbcom pages are like little rainbows.
At the end of a talk page post about the green text, Bishonen suddenly decides to refer to it as """"dye"""":  FoF Not at all forced or contrived. Lots of people refer to text as dye. Or if they don't, they should do.
Bishonen ends her post with  """"Green dye!"""" which reads as """"Green die!"""": Fof Pure coincidence. Nina Green couldn't have been further from Bishonen's mind when she wrote """"Green dye!"""". Bishonen hadn't though of Nina Green for at least 30 seconds.

FOF: This entire sequence events: Bishonen wants Nina banned, gets what she wants, posts in green text, decides to call text """"dye"""", and ends her post for no apparent reason with """"Green dye!"""" is just a random bubble of billion-to-one-coincidence. Bishonen could just have easily chosen blue text, and it would have made perfect sense to end her post with """"Blue Pigment!"""".

Vandalism Manifesto. Pass to all Wikians

VANDALISM IS GOOD. Vandalism does not come from a sheer desire to cause harm.
Vandals do their thing all over Wiki, 24/7, from frustration and hatred, 
because incompetent """"editors"""" who have no skills, no degrees, no expertise, usually no names, have done multiple reverts and edits of the work of others.
Vandalism is a good and natural response to no-lifers (as in Get a Life) who 
do 7000 edits, 10,000 edits a year and who have actual Watch Lists of 1,300
or more and are proud of it. These jerks deserve have their own pages vandalized, over and over as long as they are in effect, vandalizing the pages of others in the name of being a cop. Vandals keep no-life editors, admins, 
bureaucrats and stewards honest, or at least busy, reverting the reverts they get on their own pages. VANDALISM IS GOOD. It helps drive these nutcases into the ground with nervous breakdowns. The Culture of Wikipedia is very,very sick,

A year ago India was scarred by some of the worst sectarian violence since partition, when up to 2,000 Muslims were killed in pogroms in the western state of Gujarat, ostensibly sparked by an arson attack by Muslims on a train that killed 59 Hindu activists. Human rights organisations in India, the US and Europe implicated two organisations in the well-orchestrated attacks, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP or World Hindu Council) and its youth offshoot, the Bajrang Dal (devotees of the monkey-god Hanuman).

Now a Financial Times investigation has established that these groups receive extensive funding from Indians abroad, collected mainly as tax-free charity donations to front organisations in the US and the UK. This fundraising is coming under increasing scrutiny. So it should - as should the links between these groups and India's ruling Bharatiya Janata party (BJP).

Behind the VHP and the Bajrang Dal stands a quasi-paramilitary body, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS or Association of National Volunteers), which is the mother organisation of the Hindu revivalist BJP. Described by Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first prime minister, as """"an Indian version of fascism"""", the RSS is at the centre of a protean network of front organisations. This structure facilitates arm's-length money-raising. It also makes it easier for the RSS to deny it is inciting agitation against Muslims and Christians.....................................The RSS spends heavily on welfare and religious schools, but so do Islamist groups in the Muslim world - a danger the world has woken up to. Such ostensibly charitable activities are one reason for the groups' success. They also help pull in donations from people unaware of how some of their money is used.

The UK is formally investigating two RSS fundraising affiliates, and is considering an inquiry into the VHP. The US has also started carefully scrutinising RSS front organisations. That probe should go ahead unimpeded by Washington's ambition to develop a strategic alliance with India as a counterbalance to China's weight in Asia.

"Impact of recent student edits

This article has recently been edited by students as part of their course work for a university course.  As part of the quality metrics for the education program, we would like to determine what level of burden is placed on Wikipedia's editors by student coursework.

If you are an editor of this article who spent time correcting edits to it made by the students, please tell us how much time you spent on cleaning up the article.  Please note that we are asking you to estimate only the negative effects of the students' work.  If the students added good material but you spent time formatting it or making it conform to the manual of style, or copyediting it, then the material added was still a net benefit, and the work you did improved it further.  If on the other hand the students added material that had to be removed, or removed good material which you had to replace, please let us know how much time you had to spend making those corrections. This includes time you may have spent posting to the students' talk pages, or to Wikipedia noticeboards, or working with them on IRC, or any other time you spent which was required to fix problems created by the students' edits. Any work you did as a Wikipedia Ambassador for that student's class should not be counted.

Please rate the amount of time spent as follows:
 0 -No unproductive work to clean up
 1 - A few minutes of work needed
 2 - Between a few minutes and half an hour of work needed
 3 - Half an hour to an hour of work needed
 4 - More than an hour of work needed

Please also add any comments you feel may be helpful. We welcome ratings from multiple editors on the same article. Add your input here. Thanks!   (talk)",[],0

"Within this discussion page, I have sighted pseudo-justification for the formatting and substance of the Biopsych introductory paragraph quoting Webster’s Dictionary. Clearly, unless such source can be proven to be entirely free of advertorial motive then it ought not to be counted as a neutral source.

If as it appears, that Webster’s dictionary is the primary source of the informative substance of the introductory article, then surely Webster’s Dictionary should be cited as being the source within the opening paragraph itself. It is not proper to quote any source that has been approved merely on the basis of any unqualified assumption on the part of the current editors.

Surely a far better way to proceed with the introductory paragraph would be to quote authoritative sources either from within the field of Biopsych or otherwise having peer-related relevance. The impression that the introductory article presently creates is that of a messianic pharmaceutical cult seeking ‘out of the blue’ to command the co-operation of a wide range of medical and scientific disciplines.

Before proposing changes to the introduction, I would like the views of the current editors. Incidentally, I neither have an ‘anti-psychiatry’ agenda nor am I a ‘Scientologist’.

Hi, my thinking has been that those stub tags do not necessarily imply nationality, and just sorting them into subcategories - The changed wording when moving into position tags (the decades just add a clause onto those) could be a problem, but the phrase """"English football forward"""" is a bit ambiguous in that sense. This seemed reasonable as the idea of a stub tag, as opposed to regular categories is not to categorise people, but to group them for interested editors, so if all we know about someone is that they played English football, that is the obvious place to stub-sort them. I certainly don't have a problem with the alternate wording you mention, although I notice it has been reverted for consistency on one of the pages linked. I would be happy to go through and change all of those if there is consensus for that wording.

In most cases I think I only changed the country in persondata when a person was in Cat:English footballers, but in this case (and probably some others), I saw country of birth and location of junior club and jumped the gun.

"Wellington Metropolitan vs Wellington Urban 

As someone who has lived in Wellington off and on for 20 years (I now regard it as my home town):

In all of this one crucial fact is overlooked, the Wellington Metropolitan area includes the Kapiti Coast as far as Waikanae. There are several thousand people who commute to other parts of the urban area everyday and the Suburban rail network goes to Paraparaumu, with a planned extension to Waikanae. Almost everyone I know thinks of the Kapiti area as part of Greater Wellington.

So I am left wondering why the boffins in Wellington refuse to include this area in the Urban data. Yes I know there is the stretch of road past Paekakariki, but that's no different from the Haywards Road or the Hutt Road. In reality, in spite of the classifications, Wellington remains the second largest Metropolitan Area in New Zealand, by my calculation the population including the Kapiti suburbs is around 415,000, still around 30,000 more than Christchurch. 

If Christchurch gets to include non-contiguous suburbs (eg Halswell, Lyttelton), then so should Wellington. Not only that, Banks Peninsula was included in Christchurch in 2006 so that Bob Parker could become mayor of Christchurch and promote Christchurch as the second largest city in NZ. The reality is Christchurch has an inferiority complex, and I can say that because I'm from there. It doesn't change the fact that Wellington has more people and is more important than Christchurch, no matter which way the geographers and politicians want to spin it.

Instead of merging the pages how about creating a new one for GREATER WELLINGTON, which could include Kapiti.",[],0

If one of the nominated persons objected to the result, a poll result and votes counted. How is the vote for these constituencies managed in say the United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1895 page?

Most of the last edit seems to belong to the talk page rather than in the article, so I have moved it so I can be discussed.

Broader context
Use of the term """"psychoanalytic theory"""" implies that there is a core theory which is complete by itself.  This view is not common even among practicing analysts, who in large part recognise that the mind is a function of the brain, so that any full theory of the psyche needs to refer to the brain.  An excellent review of this is Kandel ER (1999) """"Biology and the future of psychoanalysis"""", Am.J.Psychiat 156:505.

Psychoanalytic thinking is inseparably bound also to clinical treatment of patients.  Some purists claim that achieving insight is the only goal of psychoanalysis; but health insurers generally require more concrete goals such as reduced mental illness or increased time at work.  Both of these clinical perspectives assume that the effect on actual patients is important  so they should be included in this article.  An excellent review of the clinical benefits of psychoanalysis is Fonagy, Roth & Higgitt (2005), Bull.Menninger Clinic 69(1):1-58.

This article would not be complete without consideration of substantial attacks on psychoanalysis and its theory, which have reshaped psychiatric practice in the UK and USA over the past 20-30 years.  These attacks can be classified as empirical (Gabbard, Gunderson & Fonagy 2002); financial (Detre & McDonald 1997); theoretical (Meehl 1998 calculates that there are many psychoanalytical explanations possible for any single clinical problem); and circumstantial (e.g. past failures with respect to homosexuality and childhood abuse, and the antipathy of many analysts to quantitative research:  Gabbard, Gunderson & Fonagy 2002).

Psychoanalytic theorists may have over-reached themselves in attempting to account for all troublesome psychic phenomena.  However, their concerted efforts to address more circumscribed areas have produced widely acknowledged, influential advances in the areas of defense mechanisms, attachment, the unconscious, transference and counter-transference, and the treatment of borderline personalities, among others.  Each of these advances has been accompanied by individual theories.

Suggestions for the peer-review
The article should not require a paragraph to describe what it is about; instead, its scope should simply be theories to do with psychoanalysis.  It should include subsections on the question of whether (and how) psychoanalysis can be studied objectively, whether it is disproveable in whole or part (and whether this matters), the informal """"theory"""" of the manners in which analysis can be conducted (e.g. bare room unlike Freud; methods of interpretation), and the relationships with behavioural, cognitive, and psychiatric theories.  It would be useful to have an explanation of why psychoanalysis has resisted decline so much more successfully in France than in anglophone countries.  Rather than complicated sentences with complicated words, we should be treated to simple descriptions of the differences between Freudian, Jungian, and Adlerian thinking.  Possibly in lists if that helps to simplify the sentences.""",[],0

Page Creation
So, I started the page. This is probably going to get heated, some people accusing me of saying the Course is a """"hoax"""" and all that. But I think this is an issue worthy of a page on Wikipedia because this is an important aspect of the Course. This might be interesting and beneficial. 

  

This article needs to be merged with the ACIM article or deleted
It's an issue worthy of a section of the A Course In Miracles page. It definitely isn't worth a separate article. If, as you suggest, Jesus was a source, then it deserves to be part of that article. If He wasn't, then it doesn't deserve to be anywhere. Either way, it doesn't need a separate page. 

-...wha? 

Well, that's completely just an opinion on your part. Another member and I have been discussing this on the main A Course In Miracles page. We both agreed that this deserves its own page as the topic is too expansive to maintain within the already lengthy main ACIM page. Have you taken a look at the other aspects of ACIM that have pages of their own? This certainly deserves its own page as well. And I might add that this page is not about whether I say the Course is channeled/scribed from Jesus literally. It is intended as the beginnings of an article about what is actually said in the Course and the different perspectives among """"students"""" and """"teachers"""" of the Course. Whether I myself believe one way or another has no bearing on this topic or the page itself. 
 

The existing ACIM main article is already quite long, and is intended more to be a summary of ACIM (believe it or not).  This topic is clearly a more in depth treatment of one aspect of the philosophy of ACIM than the main article, and may require its own separate long article in order to treat this subject properly.  My sense is, why not give this article a couple of weeks to settle and develop before making any clear determination about where it belongs (or doesn't belong)?

- 

 I concur. The ACIM page is quite large, and this issue is quite large.  

Removed """"Merge"""" notice

I removed the """"merge"""" notice. So far, it is three to one that this should remain its own article. If someone thinks I should give it more time, then please replace the """"merge"""" notice.   

""""Exposing a hoax""""

(Copied and pasted from discussion on main ACIM page.)

I think there is a huge misunderstanding here. I have never used the word """"hoax."""" It appears to me that you and some others who have discussed this with me, seem to think I am attempting to expose the Course, and now Catholicism, as a hoax. If you understand what I am talking about with regard to symbols, then you understand that there is no intention to """"expose a hoax"""" on my part. 

Is math a hoax to use """"5"""" all the while there are no """"5"""" characters out there in our physical world? I could stand here and go, """"Well, you know, math is all a lie, a hoax, because there really are no 5's. They've lied to you."""" Or I can say, """"The human mind cannot comprehend the principles expressed in math without use of those symbols, such as the symbol '5'."""" 

This is all I'm saying about the Course and Catholicism. 

If, as I believe, there was never literally a man who lived and was known as Jesus (and I'm not passionate about this topic one way or another, actually), then what I am saying is that even for the Catholic Church, Jesus is ultimately just a symbol. If the Catholic Church can be seen as """"math,"""" then Jesus is their """"5"""". Do you get what I mean? The symbol of """"Jesus"""" stands for something that is very real, though the symbol itself might not have actually existed in concrete, physical reality. 

The """"Jesus"""" in Catholicism (and I'm a former Catholic) often stood for persecution, suffering, agony, pain, and there is little argument from most that Catholicism brought exactly this to the world in many ways. Look at the Inquisition, and all the other horrible things the church did. And, for them, they did it in the name of """"Jesus."""" For them, Jesus symbolizes the need to do all these things. The things they did in the name of the symbol are very real; though the symbol might not have actually existed in concrete, physical reality on this planet.

The following is what is currently written in the religion section, which I am fine with. I've combined two of the paragraphs because they have to do with one poll:

Iranians of all religious backgrounds in the United States have comparatively a mix of liberal, conservative and nationalist political leaning and opinions.

 Response. I find it somewhat ironic that you're criticizing me for taking the exact actions you took. I noticed a page which I honestly felt (and still do) does not meet any of the 12 pts. in WP:MUSIC. I have no interest in their music or their entry. I only noticed them because I took the time to research the type of articles you wrote while nominating mine for deletion. When I looked at them it became obvious that they are non-notable per WP:MUSIC. I nominated the the articles and I then made pertinent comments in that AFD as any nominator would. I never accused you do doing anything surreptitiously, just pointed out that you had an interest in the outcome of the decision beyond simply being the author of the article. I even broached the bad faith subject. If you were conficent that the articles satisfied WP:MUSIC then you should have stated so in a reasoned, sourced, referenced argument and allowed it to stand up to scrutiny. If the consensus was that they met notability standards (beyond your simple assertion that they did) then the articles would have withstood review. I even offered to change my opinion if you could demonstrate notability.

 Problems I am having with Sante Kimes article and changes

I believe the change I made was of a neutral point of view and was supported by referenced links within said article.

The change I made had previously been posted by an administrator that I am apparently having trouble with.
I had hoped to work with the administrator in a constructive effort to improve the said article. However, it appears that said administrator is making changes to said article out of spite or personal feelings against me or the article's subject.
I had mentioned to the administrator in said article's discussion page that is they had a problem with the articles subject, then maybe another administrator could assist me in creating a neutral point of view for the article.

On the said article's discussion page, there have been several biased statements by said administrator about the article's subject. And, I feel, about me simply because I would like the said article to be 'balanced' and neutral.

I am wanting to document any issue here as so that if there is a problem later, it has been documented on my talk page.

"I have reverted an revised changes which Sharkbite217 undid. I assume his reasoning for the undo was because the added info contained Gogs projected involvement in Final crisis (something that seems obvious, but has not been officially announced.  I removed all predictions and made the added info stick to only the facts given in JSA #14.  I did like the addition of the fact that the origin of Gog in pre-infinite crisis does not match this current version.  Now that the addition has been fixed, I hope that anyone who edits this adds two it and does not simply revert it.  If you do revert something, explain your reasoning so we don't get into and editing war.  Thanks   
 
It is important to note that there have been three different origins for Gog. And all three characters made it to the main D.C. continuity.  His Hyperspace spanning, Time traveling, Multiverse jumping nature makes this character inherently hard to grasp when looking at the multiverse or even just the main DC universe. 
     
First, from the Kingdom Come timeline:  He Survived Kansas's destruction. Given powers by the Quintessence, he stole Superman and Wonder Woman's baby, went back through Hypertime killing Superman over and over again.  He was defeated in the Main DC continuity by Kingdom Come and main versions of the heroes.  

The second version of Gog was basically a homage to the first, but without the tricky use of Hypertime and the Kingdom come continuity.  He survived Topeka's (only) destrucion.  He kept going back in time and advancing his work over and over.  This Guy made it into the pages of Superman comics.  

The third version is the one in the current run of JSA.  He claimed he was got his power from Gog, Last God of the Third World.  And he complained about all of kansas being destroyed.  This origin actually resembles the first more than the second.  This makes it likely that he is from Earth-22, like the superman in JSA.  It is common for the new 52 Earths to resemble previous DC comic's Elseworlds, but have some differences.  It has already been shown that Earth-22 resembles Kingdom Come, but has some slight differences.  This explains the Kansas destruction being the same, but the change in his power source being from quintessence to a Third World god. Although time will tell if this is right, it does seem like the logical conclusion.  Someone can add this to the article when it is revealed in the pages of JSA.   

To answer the above question, the Quintessence were fooled.  Phantom stranger thought that this man, who came out of the Kansas massacre, and started a Superman Church, would be a good representative of the values that the quintessence hold. But they were mistaken (gods a fallible in comics).  The guy snapped after getting the powers, went a little nuts, and killed Superman over and over.  The quintessence decided not to take back their power, but I am not sure if they explained why.",[],0

I am very well read on those subjects.

Yesterday I noted a slanderous reference, linking the Canadian Red Ensign to Neo-Facists groups.  I did not appreciate the reference, not one little bit.  I posted some information in that regard.  Specifically a web-site link to the Great Canadian Flag Debate.   The Canadian Government uncharacteristically saw fit to keep an accurate archive, detailing those important events.

At any rate, you decided to remove my """"contribution"""".  However you decided to leave the """"disputed"""" reference linking the Canadian Red Ensign to the Neo-Facists groups.  I was not pleased that you choose to remove my """"contribution"""", and then decided that the Neo-Facist comment could stay.

I decided then, if my comments were to go, then the Neo-Facist comments were to go as well.  I thus have deleted them.

I don't usually get involved in things such as this, but Heraldy and Vexillology are two of my dearest passions.  So, my comments are gone fine, but why was the Neo-Facist comment left by you?

So by looking at the rules presented it might be true that it's more relevent to the Cuban/Casino-style specific salsa article however it won't take too long until it will be relevant to this page as well.

(outdent) How about looking at it like this. RPG rulebooks are just that. The rulebook explains how to play the game, but it is not the game itself. The ISBN manual you reference below supports this; games """"SHALL NOT"""" be given ISBNs. There may be some confusion in the matter, but one good example is found by harking back to AD&D; 2nd Ed.

Neither """"contained"""" the game, and the game went far beyond what was in either.

"Another CONVICTED terrorist was onboard the Mavi Marmara,  

One of the men on the Mavi Marmara spent three years in a Turkish prison for hijacking a ferry in the Black Sea in 1996; this indicates just who the “activists” were on the boat that tried to break the Gaza blockade on May 31, Foreign Ministry officials said Monday.

The Turkish newspaper Hurrieyt reported over the weekend that Erdinc Tekir, who was hurt during the IDF raid on the boat, was among the ninemember team that hijacked the Black Sea ferry to bring the 1996 war in Chechneya to the world’s attention. Tekir spent some three and a half years in prison for the incident.

 Purpose of the usage section 

I've reverted edits that came with the explanation """"The purpose of this section is not to provide usage advice or to use intuitive but inaccurate descriptions like '""""doer of the action.'""""  Actually, the original text was well-supported by citations to usage manuals, and the particular words """"doer of the action"""" are directly from The Merriam-Webster Dictionary of English Usage, which linguists consider the best usage guide.  The edited language did not cite any support for its assertions.

More broadly, even if the replacement language did have good support, I don't think it would be as good for this section.  I recognize that Wikipedia is not a how-to guide, but in a section on English usage, I think the text should explain its meaning in a way that will be understood by someone to whom it is a new subject.  Statements such as """"the passive voice is used to place focus on the grammatical patient, rather than the agent,"""" can be understood only by someone who is already knowledgeable about the subject.  That statement is also less specific than the text it replaced.    """,[],0

I recommend that you develop your user page so that people who visit your page may know your interests and share in them. It could be a single line telling others of not only your name but what you like or a complex page with every single thing that interests you on it. This is a great way of building up work groups that facilitate the sharing of expert knowledge on articles, talks etc. Happy building!!!   →  talk

Being a member of  the welcoming committee on Wikipedia I encourage you to help Wikipedia in any way you can to 
increase human knowledge. If you have credible information about a topic with verifiable references please feel free to add to that topic. If there is no article on that topic, why not start it, with time others will add to it and it may even make the featured articles list. By doing this, I have been able to make over 11000 page edits in both new articles, article improvement etc. Furthermore, I encourage you to aim to be a member of the  autoconfirmed users 
[] group as this will greatly improve your Wikipedia 
experience. You can do this by making at least 10 credible edits on Wikipedia and remaining on Wikipedia for four (4) days. Check out this page for tips.  →  talk 

Adding media to  articles
Media files, be it images, drawings or sound files are an integral part of Wikipedia's articles. They apart from enriching articles, make them more credible too. You can add media files to both your new articles as well as once you are editing. To do so you can search for it on wikipedia:commons or you can either upload the image if you have it using this file uploader or [commons uploader]. Please be informed that you must provide accurate information about the file being uploaded since they are reviewed and if if is found that the license given to the file is false, it will promptly be deleted.   →  talk 

Spotting bad edits and vandalism
As you age on Wikipedia, one thing you will come across and probably address will the issue of bad edits or vandalism. There are several ways of 
spotting them:
by reviewing articles on your watchlist regularly and looking for bad edits
verifying new changes to pages and articles
If you happen to come across a bad edit you may:
ask an editor you trust to review the work for his/her inputs
you can rollback the change if you have credible information that the edit is indeed bad
request that the necessary change be made on the article's talk page.
Whatever you do, please be very careful about the changes you make, for a rule of thumb, discuss issues you are not sure of first before making changes.  →  talk """,[],0

"Redistributional Effects of Monetary Policy

Inflation targeting is not a neutral pareto improvement.  Any choice of target
redistributes from some groups to others - making some worse off.
For example, high inflation harms holders of fixed rate debt - including
pensioneers, holders of fixed income securities, employees with protected
jobs and annuity-like compensation (including most government employees,
and policy makers, and most tenured academics), and creditors.  It benefits
net debtors - particularly if they have fixed rate debt or debt with interest
rate caps.  It also benefits owners of commodities, real estate, foreign currencies,
equity in export oriented firms, local employees in trade sensitive and
offshoring-capable sectors, and the unemployed.  Low inflation benefits
holders of fixed rate debt, business that export to the target country,
importers, employees who gain from offshoring, retired people on fixed pensions
and people with protected annuity like wages (academics, government employees,
and policy makers).  Low inflation therefore tends to favor rentiers -
increasing their wealth by boosting the purchasing power of their assets,
and transfers wealth away from debtors, owners of real estate,
owners of commodities, local import sensitive businesses, and the insecurely employed.

In theory, this could be corrected - restoring its neutrality (and Pareto improvement),
however transaction costs, moral hazard, information asymmetry and political 
resistance would make such wealth transfers grossly impractical.

To the extent that Monetary policy creates a known and predictable transfer
of wealth between a priori known counterparties, it is not a neutral economic tool 
and cannot be divorced from political considerations and preferred constituencies.

Furthermore, such constituencies will try to influence choice of monetary policy
targets - rentiers/creditors and pensioners will prefer tight monetary policy, 
debtors will prefer looser monetary policy, as will exporters and other participants
in (internationally)tradeable sectors of the economy, owners of commodities  
and real estate, and the precariously employed

If redistribution of wealth via such mechanisms has differential efficiency
impact and impacts the network of business formation and production within
and between trading nations, some monetary policy targets may also move
an economy away from an efficient frontier.

Moral Hazard of Monetary Policy Making Agents 

From a principal agent perspective, monetary policy makers face 
a personal moral hazard - since their compensation typically takes the
form of a secure fixed annuity.  This would incentivize them to favor
tight monetary policy - even at the expense of lower real GDP growth.
Compensation schemes that made their personal wealth inversely related
to the unemployment rate would create a moral hazard in favor of overly
loose monetary policy.  Compensation schemes that made their personal wealth 
contingent on real GDP growth may be more efficient by reducing their
overall moral hazard.",[],0

Thanks for getting back to me. I share your """"opinion that we should point out clearly and repeatedly that both Republicans and Democrats are clearly to the right of the demographic center,"""" and I agree it seems like a minority opinion in the mass media. But I still view it as a neutral opinion. With this view, the idea that """"the Democratic Party is almost evenly divided between left-of-center liberals and more centrist moderates"""" seems irrelevant in the lead of an American Left article. I thought that text written in the prefaces to the Encyclopedia of the American Left might hold sway over other editors by serving to dispel disagreements about the scope, lead, and the most important subdivisions of topic. That might be the case in German Wikipedia, and I think it's the case here in science and history articles, but, in politics, perhaps no academic authority can ever hold sway over editors here. This means that even the foundational defining terminology of US politics articles like this one with a potentially ambiguous scope might never be stable.

Rather than have a long detailed discussion here about which opening is better, I'll simply point out that in the current version, even after you read the entire first paragraph, you still don't have a clue why this article exists. You do find out what Marco Rodríguez does for a living though. So yay for that.

Brazil 1–7 Germany was the shock result of the first semi-final of the 2014 FIFA World Cup men's international football tournament, played on 8 July at the Estádio Mineirão in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. It broke Brazil's 62-match home unbeaten streak in competitive matches going back to 1975, and equalled their biggest margin of defeat, tied with a 6–0 loss to Uruguay in 1920, leading it to be described as a national humiliation. The game also saw Germany score the most goals in World Cup history, their 223 overtaking Brazil's 221. Their second goal meant Germany's Miroslav Klose reached 16 World Cup goals, overtaking Brazil's Ronaldo as the tournament's all-time record goalscorer. The game was subsequently referred to by the press as the Mineirazo, evoking the spirit of the Maracanazo in which Brazil unexpectedly lost the 1950 FIFA World Cup on home soil to Uruguay.""",[],0

 ==Tbma own original research 

First Tbma only a few days after calling this whole article a hoax has fund a new sources to breakdown this article to crap.

First he claims the Soviet had preplanned its withdraw from the front, but Finnish sources who is supported by POW interview, intellegnce data and Otho Manninen extended archives research in SOviet/Russian archives have pinpointed exactlly witch Soviet units where pressent in the battle and when they left.

What we now for certaint is: The composistion of the Soviet major combat formations where pressent, they Soviet was reinforced by 100 tanks and SPG before the battle, and during the battle 21 Soviet army sent more of its formation in to the battle. 

This contradics any statment of withdraw to other fronts or the redicules low figure as only 60000 Soviet red army men.

What about Tbma sources?

The Sources of 60000 men from """"Punaiset panssarit - Puna-armeijan panssarijoukot 1918-1945"""" is by no mean to be seen as a final statment over the battle as the book is abour red army tank, and just uses a few phrases on the Tali-Ihantala battle.

 More on changes made to """"Early Soviet Rule and World War II section"""" 

I will not respond to the personal attack directed at """"the person who simply reverted this passage..."""". As for the substance of the issue:

1. Reasons of Capital move to Kharkov. ProhibitOnions introduced to the article an idea that one of the reasons of the capital move was the fact Kharkov's was more dominated by ethnic Russians than Kiev. This claim has some logic in the context of the events, but I have not seen this claim made in any serious source. If this is due to my ignorance, I suggest ProhibitOnions provides at least some references, or, if he can't find them off hand, at least gives some hints where he saw this info, so that it can be checked. His statement on the talk page that """"many historians concede"""" on this is too vague of a reference. If this is indeed his own speculation based on his interpretation of the logic of events, this qualifies as original research, whose place is current scholary or popular publications, personal web-sites, etc., but not an encyclopedia, which should reflect an established knowledge.

2. Possible role of famine in the capital return to Kiev.  PO agrees, that the discussion of the issue belongs to other articles but thinks, it is also relevant here. My point is that this info is factually accurate, but its relevance is too remote. Deliberate killing milions of people was a horrible crime, but Kiev itself, unlike the vast regions of Ukrainian countryside, was not ravaged by famine. Should the info on the deliberate famine caused by the actions of the Bolshevik government be introduced into every article related to any Ukrainian topic? If PO helps me understand why famine should be in Kiev article, I am open to ideas. 

3. Finally, PO removed from the article the statement that Kiev growth was mostly caused by migration from other parts of Ukraine which indeed re-established Ukrainian spirit in the city, which is confirmed, for example, by a relative rise of Ukrainian theater and literature in Kiev at the time. He substituted it by the statement about """"the migration from other parts of the Soviet Union."""" Where does he get this info?

The changes he introduced seem ideological rather that relevant and I reverted them once. Now, I laid out my reasons and will wait for some days for comments rather than reverting this changes right now. Please, no flames.  19:00, Mar 15, 2005 (UTC)""",[],0

The hacking community was also infuriated by his habit of making the latest hacking developments public, with his publication of technical details on phone phreaking earning him top spots on the “Most Hated Person” charts in the Worldcharts diskmag for several years.

That is truely an amazing version of the story. If you read these discmags the title """"most hated person"""" came from rumors that Kim Schmitz had denunciatet many members of the BBS scene. Since this version is not citeable neither should be in the article. 

His legal team maintained that this was not insider trading as the information did not come from anybody else and Schmitz had created the business opportunity himself. “I think the outcome would be different in a court of law today as the Internet bubble had just burst at the time, everyone had lost a lot of money and there was so much media attention that I became the scapegoat,” Schmitz maintained.

Where does this statement come from? Why is that relevant?

Schmitz later conceded he had been young, stupid, naïve and aggressive. “I had no idea about the legal implications of my actions,” he acknowledged. “I hope my mistakes can therefore serve as an example for young entrepreneurs. They should remember one golden rule be careful and always think twice about what you are doing.”

This is a sentence for an autobiography, not an Wikipedia article.

Schmitz, who has also long been a fan of Formula I and organised several big parties for the races in Monaco, now plans to develop a racetrack and is currently scouting potential sites around the world.

As for the question, if races exist, the answer is clear: Races don't exist, because Spencer Wells, Guido Barbujani and Alan Templeton say they don't. Every other opinion is a misinterpretation of facts by racist bigots. Well, there are few seemingly racial clusters appearing in recent genetic studies, and they very well agree with the classical anthropological division of humans. Furthermore, when geographical distance is constant, the genetic distance between groups within these clusters is several times lower than between groups from different clusters. The main detected bareers of genetic flow are also consistent with the borders of traditional races. Moreover, the genetic distances between these clusters are typical for mammals routinely divided into subscpecies by biologists. However, this all must be due to some misinterpretation of facts by racist bigots, because Spencer Wells, Guido Barbujani and Alan Templeton say that race doesn't exist.   22:56, 22 April",[],0

"""

(deindent) Sorry for kibitzing, but I wanted to be fair to all points of view, even those of the dualists. so I tried to stick to presenting the thought experiments without drawing conclusions.

The thought experiment is this:

 you have one observer
 The observer gets cloned into copy 1 and copy 2 (either Hubert/Yorick or star-trek style)
 The copies diverge, either because of internal noise, or because of the environment

From a third person point of view, this is an objective description of the evolution of a physical system, there is absolutely no ambiguity about what is going on- one observer becomes two. If probed, each copy would say that they were the initial observer before the cloning event. But viewed from the inside, if you are the observer getting cloned, there is a very natural question you can ask: Am I going to end up being copy 1 or am I going to be copy 2? This question cannot even be formulated from the outside, so it has no objective answer, but it is subjectively very important if you are the observer.

This scenario is Dennett's (and to some extent Everett's). Since the question doesn't even make sense when formulated in the third person perspective, the answer to this question does not lie in the position and velocities of any atoms. You might conclude that this question doesn't make any sense. But, in any case, the answer to this question is 1 bit of subjective information which both copy 1 and copy 2 know, and which the original observer does not. In the objective third person view, there is no information gained- you know that copy 1 will say """"I am copy 1"""" and copy 2 will say """"I am copy 2"""".

To give an example of actual OR and SYNTH, I'll go beyond Dennett's example: suppose that the copying goes on indefinitely, so that the cloning keeps happening again and again. Then it is very difficult to say what it feels like for the observer, from the first person perspective. For example, take a star-trek duplicator, and duplicate the observer, and then duplicate each duplicate, but add a twist: the duplicator keeps the data from the first duplication event in its memory banks, and makes a third copy in the exact same state twenty years later, and starts duplicating that observer too in the same way. And then it does so again forty years later, then sixty years later. What is the subjective experience? From a naive counting perspective, I should predict that I would be nearly certainly teleported in time to some distant future point, because the number of future copies of my present state is vastly greater than the two present copies. On the other hand, the total number of observers descended from the current duplicates will always outnumber the observers descended from the future duplicates. So perhaps the right counting is by the number of descendents at each time slice, rather than by the total number of descendents of my present state. Even worse, how can my subjective experience change depending on whether somebody millions of years in the future turns off the darned duplicator? (Boltzmann's brain is a similar idea).  """,[],0

 'Assessment' vs. 'diagnosis' 

This section was moved here from /Comments subpage by TalkCs  

I am new to this, and finding my way, so sorry if I get things wrong. I am a British Art Therapist(and a Council Member, British Association of Art Therapists). The art therapy article as it stands is very US based, and there are significant differences. I propose to start contributing to the page with this in mind. My first proposed addition is this, in the section on assessment tools:

'It is important to note however that attitudes to assessment differ internationally. 'Assessment' is easily confused with 'diagnosis'. Because diagnosis is a medical function rather than a therapeutic one, British art therapists tend to resist the implied medicalisation of what is essentially a non medical approach, which concentrates on 'seeing the person, not the label'. The British Association of Art Therapists statement on diagnosis simply states that ‘Art Therapists do not diagnose…' (http://www.baat.org.uk)'

 Sorry, WilyD, but re-stating a flawed argument doesn't validate it. You're starting from the standpoint that the one true meaning of a word is the one used in a single place and, thus, all other different uses of the word are invalid. This is not true. Although movies and books have made """"American"""" an understood term for """"from the United States"""" in most countries """"American"""" is used for the landmass and not the country. In Latin America (which comprises far more people than the USA itself) the term """"Americano"""" is used for the landmass and the continents, not for a country. This may sit well because as you've implied """"America"""" has always been for you your country and while this is respectable it doesn't mean your opinion is more valid that the one from those that don't share it. Incidentally, stating that only your local opinion is valid is as much soapboxing as you're trying to lay on others. Unless the Wikipedia is suddenly defined to be formally U.S.A.-Centric (and being in english obviously doesn't count) then """"rest-of-the-world"""" views are perfectly acceptable. This page exists, in part, to make it clear that """"American"""" is not always a demonym of the USA and this is a fact. As much a fact as U.S. citizens believen it does.

Dear Arkaever, what you write makes absolutely no sense - and your spelling of """"hypothesis"""" with """"hi"""" at the beginning is the first hint that it is so.

Everyone who has ever visited places both in the continental climate and near the ocean must know that places near the oceans have much more stable temperatures (while the continental climate has much more brutal variations) because the relevant layer of water has much higher heat capacity than the relevant layer of soil. The water is circulating and can actually swallow or release the heat from up to hundreds of meters of the upper ocean pretty quickly; on the other hand, it takes years for the heat to get dozens of meters of the soil.

That's also why the continental ice sheets are much more variable - and much more important for the global variability of the climate - than effects that occur on the sea. They may appear or disappear mostly on the Northern Hemisphere. At any rate, the Milankovitch theory works, as settled in Roe's paper. You shouldn't try to promote your amateurish and scientifically meaningless opinions about difficult subjects on Wikipedia - opinions that, as you admit, are on par with creationism.

 Orlando """"Jonathan Blanchard"""" Bloom 

I anyone tries to add this back, here's the story. Back in 2005 or so, my roomate (Jonathan Blanchard, or as we call him Jo) had pretty long hair and his then girlfriend called him Jorlando Bloom, as a general funny/derogatory insult. It pissed him off and we started to call him that for a while. Apparently one of us got on Wikipedia and vandalised the page . About two days ago, he found out, and thought I recently vandalized the page, but we checked the history and it turned out to date from March 2005. That's nearly 4 years ago! Then  added a reference for this , probably in good faith, but for the various biographical details (date of birth, etc...). 

So now you have a ton of mirrors and sources that based themselves on this Wikipedia article, saying that Orlando Bloom's full name is Orlando Jonathan Blanchard Bloom. Hell, even the disambiguation page was affected , again probably in good faith (and then reverted a few days ago, by my roomate ).

So don't let anyone add this back. {ταλκκοντριβς – WP Physics} """,[],0

I hadn't heard about that, but it's no big deal to me either way. I made the change because the text as it stood made it seem that Road to Perdition was his first introduction to US audiences, which on the evidence of Tomb Raider was manifestly untrue. If there is clear evidence of Elizabeth'''s priority, I have no problem with that.  
I'm not familiar enough with Elizabeth to be certain. I do know it was listed as one of his career highlights more often than Tomb Raider when he was announced as Bond; the only time I saw Tomb Raider connected to him in the media was when it was rumored Angelina Jolie was up for the role of Vesper.  

While it's probably the better film — and was even nominated for the Best Picture Oscar — from memory his role in Elizabeth is a relatively minor one. Certainly he wasn't one of the main stars (who were pretty much Cate Blanchett, Geoffrey Rush, Joseph Fiennes and Craig's Our Friends in the North'' co-star Christopher Eccleston).

WP:COI concerns and solutions for this article
User:Lordradish asked a question about my possible conflict of interest - WP:COI.  First, always look at Wikipedia policies if you think there is an issue, don't just go away angry. I know that I'm still learning Wikipedia policies and just reading the above I can see that in 2007-2008 period I was somewhat confused about a couple of them. The longer you are here, the more sensitive you become to all of them through experience.

Re: COI questions, usually its better to start that on a talk page per WP: """"The first approach should be direct discussion of the issue with the editor, referring to this guideline."""" Actually, I thought this issue explicitly had been dealt with here before, but reading through I see I evidently confused it with a related COI question elsewhere. Anyway, I'll respond in interest of full disclosure, outline questions I think have to be asked on the talk page of any editor here who gives any indication of being familiar with the issue, and suggest some possible ways of dealing with WP:COI issues here.

My possible WP:COI
To answer Lordradish's question, I have contributed 43 blog entries to the secessionist blog Vermont Commons over the last 38 months. I have not been paid.  My blog entries have been more generally related to the topic of secession and occasionally make passing references to Vermont and its secession issues, including in comments on others' entries. I don’t live in Vermont and don't intend to. I don't consider myself a member of any Vermont Secession group. As far as I remember, I only have corresponded with the Vermont Commons editor, and that by email. I get some irregular Vermont Commons email and mailings and occasional Second Vermont Republic snail mails. 
I also have suffered a couple years of vicious and even libelous off wiki attacks from the anonymous blogger who does vermontsecession.blogspot, including because I edited this page, and including at another blogspot page he set up just to ridicule me with incredible sexist ire. Therefore I have come to know far more about what types of individuals may be making very POV and COI edits to this article than I would have otherwise.
I do feel I have sufficient COI to make sure I declare it, as I now have, and to be very careful of my edits per WP:COI#Editors_who_may_have_a_conflict_of_interest. 

Possible WP:COI of other editors 
In the 2007-2008 period there was some extreme POV editing of this article by individuals who I believe had very strong personal and financial connections to Vermont organizations and individuals, far stronger than mine. They are strongly motivated to trash or downplay the significance of Second Vermont Republic and don't care much about Wikipedia policies.  Therefore here are some questions that might have to be asked on such suspected persons' talk pages (or here, but guidance on that appreciated). And I hope it’s ok to outline these general questions given the track record of this particular article.

General questions include: are you the anonymous blogger who does vermontsecession.blogspot.com which, while using some information from reliable sources, has a track record of unrelenting nasty, exaggerated and unprofessional attacks on individuals, often with little or even contrary evidence presented; is that person a close personal associate?; do you work for or with that person in some other capacity, such as at a publication or a blog or a sometimes paid campaign staffer?; are you a Democratic or Republican Party activist or contractor or potential contractor who fears that secession candidates running in 2012 might take votes away from Democratic Party candidates and throw the election to a Republican. (According to official returns the candidate Pete Garritano mentioned in th is article got 3.7% of the returns, something not yet in the article.)  Depending on whether a candidate was a more right or left winging secessionist, such a 2012 candidate could away enough votes to sway an election to the opponent of someone support by the editor.

If other editors who seem to be too pro-Vermont Secession arise, obviously relevant questions could be asked of them on their talk page or here.

Dealing with special WP:COI concerns of this article
Given the problems described above, I can think of possible solutions:
 I am going to ask some neutral editors - those who have not been active opining on the secession topic or me - to look at this section and opine.
 If Wikipedia:Pending changes is implemented, this article may need to be put on the list.

For something like this, providing a reason for reverting only in the edit summary is insufficient. If the phrase should really be there, I would suggest that a post regarding that phrase should be made on this talk page - this is just another way of reaching out to the anoymous user. As suggested below, if that particular editor is sincere, they would participate in rational discussion here. Otherwise, I suppose the edits can be treated as you did before.

Yet another triumph for the forces of darkness at Wikipedia. I also note again that the erroneous claims and deceit on the part of the editor making the complaint once more go completely unaddressed.

If any editors are interested in how there is a leftist bias prevailing within politics pages at WP, and how this is upheld by Admin when a challenge is made from an editor interested in correcting this, I invite them to look at what has been going on recently at the Roger Scruton page, which now will go on reading like an article that would be written by a left-wing tabloid and not an encyclopedia entry. The pattern, for those who are interested, is as follows:

 Leftist editor posts biased and inaccurate entries on WP politics page based on prejudice and ignorance, or in pursuit of an agenda to discredit a figure on the right of the political spectrum;
 Posts challenged by another editor;
 Leftist editor cannot cope with being challenged and having his ignorance/bias/agenda exposed;
 Leftist editor creates trumped-up (and in the latest example regarding the 3RR violation, in fact completely bogus) charges against the editor that has """"wronged"""" him and brings them to admin – a tactic that the """"wronged"""" editor knows will result in the """"blocking"""" (in effect censorship) of the editor who tried to address the leftist bias.

This is a process of censorship, and the procedure that is gone through at Admin nothing more than a show trial. It is rather ironic that I should see proof positive of this leftist bias at the Scruton page – Scruton has after all himself been vilified by the left throughout his career.   """,[],0

Where we very often see big controversies, though, is with editors who are disruptive while trying to help.

That entry does not provide any step by step process for allowing us to express our concerns regarding editors who are editing outside their areas of expertise.  So Wikipedia policy clearly states that competence is required...but it doesn't give us anything to do about it.

 Questions about a certain [reversion] edit   

I have some questions about this edit. 

I did not remove the character string that [supposedly] is the title.  That is, the string that is the title according to the """"edit comment"""" which says: """"um, no, the title is the line above that"""".] 

On the other hand, this edit (see above) did remove the character string that (IMHO) was a better title.  (That is, the string that I thought was better, as [all or part of] a """"title"""" for the web page with the URL of http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=1&taxon;_id=128944 .) 

I am not immediately ready to """"insist"""" that leaving in both of those two character strings is the best choice.  (However, if you have any comments about that """"idea"""", I am willing to listen.)  

I am prepared to try to reach some consensus.  Is there anything we can do to explore (or discuss) (or, explain to each other) the goals that are [perhaps] to be achieved by choosing well, [and carefully] which character string to use as the """"title""""?   (or, maybe that should say, << the goals that are """"more nearly"""" to be achieved >> by doing so) (- ? -). 

Would it benefit anyone (perhaps in pursuing the above mentioned goals?) if one of us were to explore (or discuss) (or, explain) the reasons why the use of the character stringSabal Adanson ex Guersent, Bulletin des Sciences, par la Societe Philomatique. 87: 205-206. 1804 for the """"title"""", would be better? 

Do we both understand (thoroughly and well) what each word of that """"title"""" means, and what its role is, in doing whatever things a title is supposed to be helpful for?  (such as, describing the """"topic"""" of a certain web page, and informing the reader a little bit, what a certain web page is """"about"""" - ? - ) 

Do we both (or, do any of us) think that this """"title""""Sabal Adanson ex Guersent, Bulletin des Sciences, par la Societe Philomatique. 87: 205-206. 1804 comes closer to describing the """"topic"""" of the web page, or otherwise (in some sense) doing thoroughly and well those things that a title is [/slash, """"should"""" be] helpful for? 

Have both of us [sufficiently] considered the question of what the web page with the URL of (value of the """"url"""" field) is about?  IMHO, it comes pretty close to being about """"Palmetto"""".  I could be wrong... 

I hope this does not sound [too] negative.  I hope that there is still a chance that one of us can wake up and learn something, that is not already known (at least, something that we don't both already know).  So, maybe there is hope for a happy, win-win outcome, that will be the best for all concerned.  (It would even be fine with me, if [after reaching some consensus successfully] we were to nuke this whole section, if [e.g.] we both wanted to delete it before it got in to any """"archive"""" files.) """"No harm / no foul.""""  (getting in to """"history"""" logs,  or, """"remaining"""" in them  might be a different matter.) 

You are welcome (btw) to answer some questions that I did not [know to] ask.  (""""if any"""").  

The kindness of a response (and/OR an edit that restores the word """"Palmetto"""") would be appreciated.  Thank you.    """,[],0

My personal attacks are in fact a critic of wikipedia system in view of recent actions of some editors, and the critic of the us government and other general, very, assertions, but nothing persdonal. As for vandalism I was the one being vandalised and reacting to it on a very propper way by propper actions, as reinserting ALL persons edits and not just mine, with significant informations as my reason to do so.
I also think that some people in the story have been pretty quick at giving blame without having read anything of the contain wich say one or two things about their morality and how they view the WP/NPA, biaize, if you see what i mean.

It was before I actually participate in any debate or talk page.
I begin to do so the 10th PM and was banned the 14th PM
It went very fast, with revert and archivising and reverting of all my edits, and my banishment in the course of the 14th, less than 9 hours exactly.

"WP:MOSMED is the Manual of Style for articles that come under any of the Medical categories. All medical-related articles have to comply to reach Good Article (GA) or above (hehe - I only found out about it at the second GA Review!).
Try typing 'Paul Bert' into the search box in the left column of any page and click the 'Search' button (rather than pressing Enter or clicking the Go button). You'll get the search results - the article Paul Bert is first, and Oxygen toxicity is fourth. If you click the Go button instead, you go direct to the article if it exists, otherwise you get the search results as before. Try the same test searching for 'Paul Bert effect'.
There is an article on Decompression sickness - we plan to tackle that after we have finished getting Nitrogen narcosis to GA. No need to mention those in Oxygen toxicity - although all of them are summarised in Scuba diving#Effects_of_breathing_high_pressure_gas.
The partial pressure of oxygen is the trigger for OxTox: that is found by multiplying the fraction of oxygen by the ambient pressure at the depth you're at. For example, air is 21% oxygen and the pressure at 50 metres is 6 bar. So you have a partial pressure of oxygen (ppO2) of 0.21 x 6 = 1.26 bar. That's safe from CNS OxTox as it's never been observed at less than 1.3 bar. Divers may use gas mixtures different from air, however - take a look at Nitrox for more information.
It's my pleasure to try to explain where I can. I must admit it was a little mischievous of me to throw you in at the deep end on Oxygen toxicity . But believe me, the discipline needed to meet all the style requirements is a great learning experience and worth the effort.

"""==Another specific example====
Under Genetic explanations, WRN has written this - 

To support these claims, they often cite several lines of evidence that they interpret as support for a partly genetic cause of group differences in IQ:   1. Black–White–East Asian differences in IQ, reaction time, and brain size are observed worldwide in a range of cultures and environments. In the United States, significant Black-White IQ differences are observable at every age above 3 years, within every occupation or socioeconomic level tested, in every region of the country, and at every time since the invention of ability tests.[106]   2. Jensen and other have argued that the magnitude of race differences on different IQ subtests correlate with the extent to which those subtests measures g,[107] which also correlates with measures of the subtests heritability.[108] From these and other findings, they argue that race differences have a partly biological basis.[109]   3. The rising heritability of IQ with age (within all races; studies have found on average in the developed world heritability starts at 20% in infants, rises to 40% in middle childhood, and peaks at 80% in adulthood); and studies showing the virtual disappearance (~0.0) by adulthood of shared environmental effects on IQ (for example, family income, education, and home environment), with adopted siblings partaking in the studies no more similar in IQ than with strangers[110] From these studies, they argue that most suggested environmental explanations for IQ difference between groups do not have a strong enough effect on IQ to fully account for group differences.
4. Studies of US comparisons of both parents to children and siblings to each other finding regression to differing means for different races (85 for Blacks and 100 for Whites) across the entire range of IQs,[111] despite the fact that siblings are matched for shared environment and genetic heritage, with regression unaffected by family socioeconomic status and generation examined[112]

This seems to be excessive detail.  WRN has essentially recreated Rushton/Jensen arguments, and placed citations in his citation.  This essentially allows WRN to write an entire section, as if it were incontrovertible based on various references, without any possible response.  The NPOV fact that should be reported is that Rushton and Jensen make some assertions, not that they make some assertions, and here is the factual evidence they use to back it up.  If anything, every one of their """"lines of evidence"""" should be attributed directly to Rushton and Jensen, as much of that same evidence may be interpreted as undermining the """"genetic hypothesis"""", depending on the viewer.  It seems very weaselly, in any case.

My concern with the RfC title could, of course, have been solved by retitling it, but that would not solve the issue that the discussion was focused on editor behavior rather than improvements to the article. Based on the comments to the AN/I where I requested review of my early close and to the talkpage discussion it spawned, I think it might have been better to retitle, collapse the sniping, and attempt to focus the discussion based on the few remaining comments.

 HJM - I would be happy to see you (or anyone) open a neutrally worded mediation discussion with the aim of reducing the adversarial atmosphere, but the venue needs to be appropriate to the issues. Several editors there have expressed concerns with the MedCab process, so Wikipedia:WikiProject Environment (perhaps after creating a dedicated taskforce) would seem a good place to discuss organization of the whole family of articles, and RfC/U or ArbCom would be good for discussing editor conduct. There have already been a number of RS/N, NPOV/N, and BLP/N discussions of related issues that could probably be exhumed for background. I have some hope, though, that the recent infusion of fresh blood might work out a solution without escalation.

 sockpuppets on Physician

Thank you for reverting these edits.

I don' know why, but this article attracts lots of anonymous editors who like to delete without any explanation. I have asked a sysop (User:Shii) to semiprotect the article  he did this a month ago.

About 15 kilobytes (3/7 of the then total), including 2 large subsections, kept on being deleted by an apparent User:Nq0x77. One of the subsections (Other designations) has been in the article largely unchanged for well over a year; the wording here was earlier the subject of much discussion & editing because it concerned potentially controversial matters, but this was apparently resolved. When I tried Nq0x77's page to ask why, there was'nt one! No explanation of why the deletions are wise is shown on the Talk page. I've restored the article to the version left by User:Cubs197 earlier today, and you restored a further revert. The article has (or had)reached B class status, and is rated as top-importance, so I suggest major edits may merit at least some discussion, and I couldn't do this because User:Nq0x77 doesn't seem to be available.

 User:Shii wrote to me: just blocked the sockpuppet instead.  (tock) , and I have just replied: Thank you very much but, sadly, I think the same person is at it again, this time using a new and different sockpuppet (User: Pednursing ?), who has just made the same ~15kb deletion.

Speedy deletion of Jacob Silver
 A tag has been placed on Jacob Silver requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia.

 User:Alien3 thinks I'm edit warring... 

...which is confusing, since I'm not even close to 3RR. But, anyway, I thought I'd drop by and explain my reasons for pulling the cite from the first sentence of the article. Per WP:LEDECITE: 
Leads are usually written at a greater level of generality than the body, and information in the lead section of non-controversial subjects is less likely to be challenged and less likely to require a source.... 
Pedantic semantic squabbling aside, I don't think there's anyone who contests the validity of the characterization of MM as """"progressive."""" Given that the same assertion is sourced exactly one paragraph later, I think the citation should be cut from the lede. 

All that said, I'm not sold on MM being a reliable source for characterizations about itself. Suppose, for the sake of argument, that MM described itself as """"impartial"""" (it doesn't, btw). Would it be alright, then, for Wikipedia to describe MM as an """"impartial media watchdog,"""" replete with cite to their web site? IMO, MM can't be a WP:RS for information about MM; they're biased, and anything they say about themselves is inherently POV. What's more, if we're not taking MM at their word, but, instead, only citing them for claims that Wikipedia editors find credible, that's differently problematic for being WP:OR. It's not our place to weigh the veracity of primary sources; we shouldn't even be using them.

To the end of sidestepping the whole issue, I'd like to offer this source instead for the claim that MM is a progressive organization: . But I don't think it should appear in the lede, either.

"From local anesthesia 

Text removed from local anesthesia which IMO might be better placed here, please review.  

Generally, a certain risk of local tissue damage is involved when using local anesthetics often and regularly during a longer period at a specific location of your body. For example, the chronic use of topical eye anesthetics in chronic eye pain would almost certainly and relatively quickly lead to serious eye damage (corneal damage).
Before using local anesthetics, chronic local pain should not only carefully be assessed with medical specialists for the local problem (for example an ophtalmologist, dermatologist, dentist or a neurologist/specialist for peripheral nerve blocks), but also by specialists for centrally active pain medication.
 Medical specialists (ophtalmologists, dermatologists, dentists or neurologists for peripheral nerve blocks) for the local problem can assess how big the risk of chronically using local anesthetics at that particular location is.
 In most cases of chronic pain, it is not the peripheral nervous system but the central nervous system that is not able to cope with the pain impulses coming from the location in the peripheral nervous system where the damage that causes the pain is actually located. Therefore, medical specialists for the central nervous system (usually a neurologist or pain specialist) can assess if and what kind of centrally acting medication can or should be taken. Very often, it is less harmful and risky to use centrally active substances (especially when they are only taken in low doses) against chronic pain in the peripheral nerve system than chronically using local anesthetics at a particular location of the body. Relatively risk free, especially when taken in small doses, and at the same time often effective against chronic peripheral pain are antidepressants of the SSRI class and the stronger tricyclic antidepressants like for example amitriptyline. Furthermore, modern anticonvulsants like pregabalin or gabapentin are relatively risk free and at the same time relatively effective against chronic pain, at least when taken in very low or low doses. One of the strongest and more risky options in the reduction of peripheral pain are anticonvulsants like carbamazepine. On the other hand, some other classes of centrally acting substances like for example opioids (they are unfortunately still often used in the treatment of chronic pain, including local pain in the peripheral nerve system) are extremely harmful and should be avoided in the treatment of chronic pain at all costs.",[],0

 Pozdrav 

Pozdrav Direktore, ovo je tekst koji sam stavio odmah iza tvog odgovora na diskusionoj strani od clanka """"Differences between standard Serbian/Croatian/Bosnian language"""". Pozdrav tebi i sve najbolje:
Totally agree with you Direktor, and I am sure that your highly reasonable opinions and facts you are presenting on wikipedia are highly respected and accepted by the waste majority of its readers. Please, if you can, - do your regular check-ups of the articles concerning South Slavic languages and make sure they’re not presenting some misleading information. I would just add to this, that although ‘the political reason is the officially maintained distaste of the so-called """"pan-Yugoslav commonness”’, this distaste should be ‘expressed’ in a more civilized manner than creating some non-acceptable partial maps showing only a half of the Shtokavian speaking area, or trying to camouflage the factual state of the close ties within the Central South Slavic system (language) at the templates featured in the articles about South Slavic languages and dialects. And most importantly - that ridiculous ‘pan-Yugo’ distaste which openly sends a message of hatred and separatism, should not, by any mean be reflected in the language area, because it only shows how low and how uncivilized its ‘supporters’ can be, no matter what ‘not-supported-by anyone-in-scientific-world’ theories they may point out as their sources. 
And, at the end, as an example of a civilized political distaste between nations, here’s the example of Americans and Canadians. Majority of Canadians feel in a different extent, a kind of aversion to Americans, especially since the start of the ‘George-Bush-era’ in USA. But still, nobody says that Canadians speak a ‘different language’ than Americans, and nobody tries to hide the common history facts and the strong cultural and economical ties that exist between these 2 countries. This is a typical way of overcoming any kind of ‘distaste’ in a human and civilized way, all the other ways are just a shame for humanity.

"Section 'Subdivisions' should be more than a list. 

I hate to complain about a problem, rather than just fix the problem, but I really don't know enough about biology to be productive here.

The Problem: I read eudicots, rosids, and asterids.  Although each article lists some representative species, I (the reader) have no understanding what criteria was used to subdivide eudicots into rosids and asterids (and others).  Why is one plant a rosid but not an asterid?  These articles read as though plant life is subdivided arbitrarily, though I suspect the subdivision is somewhat rational.  My intuition tells me that there must be some expressible, meaningful distinction between these subgroups.

The Proposal: Is there some way to describe the grouping here?   I propose a brief summary of the characteristics which divide rosids and asterids.  I think this summary should be a list of differences, each difference taking this form:
 Rosids feature X.  In contrast, Asterids feature Y.

"Results Summary/Elimination Chart Semi-final placements  

On the elimination chart, I have replaced the 'adv' with other things that make more sense. 'Adv' is very vague. From the chart, I can gather that the top 3 voted contestants advanced. That is however not the case in reality. The top 3 females may have more votes that the top male but still the highest voted male, female and the next highest vote getter advanced. I have put a footnote at the bottom of the chart which says something along the lines of 'every week highest male, female and next highest advanced. Every week, 2 males advanced however it was never revealed which male was the highest and which male won the non-gender specific slot'... Because of this I have replaced 'adv' with 'Top 2' in the cyan colour for male contestants and 'Top' in pink for the female contestants that were non wild-card as we know that they were the highest female vote getters.

I notice that this RfC is dead but SH just removed a sock's comment. I actually do think this conversation is fine staying open since there is not consensus and inclusion v not is essentially WP:FREQUENT. I did not notice NickCT's comment until now but wanted to address it since we have already gone over this but people seem to forget or have to rattle it off everytime it comes up. I for one think """"massacre"""" in some form should be mentioned in the lead. Unfortunately, the assertion that it is what """"people involved call it"""" is contradicted by the following:
Gaza Victory: enough said but just a reminder, it can't be a massacre and a victory can it?
""""Gaza Massacre"""" has been disputed as a title with the sources mirroring its forced use on Wikipedia
Hamas did not have an official name for it. This has been discussed and it is a point conceded by those in favor of inclusion. Hamas simply did not use its limited PR capabilities to clearly lay this out as their preferred title (see point 1).
But back to my point of keeping this open. I have offered two solutions. Nableezy has rejected at leas one of them. 
Include """"it has been called a massacre"""". No bold. Not an alternative title. Just simply lay it out there. One editor recently provided a source calling it """"Massacre in Gaza"""". It was obviously referred to as a massacre. 
or
Include every title that was verifiably used in RS at a ratio of tens of thousands to one. This could be accomplished by actually adding information in the lead about the media and its relation t this topic. This would increase the quality of the article by meeting WP:LEAD] by being an actual summary. 
I'm not going to lie, I think it is time to change the title of this article altogether.  notice that other language's Wikipedia projects refer to it as the Israeli operational name (some editors have equated this to POV even though it is a very common and accurate title) or one laying out the dates and calling it a conflict (as we used to do but it was really long). That discussion will eventually come up again and any decision here will get scuttled by it (or the opposite). But it is clear that giving prominence to a very little used and POV dripping title in the lead is not acceptable to many editors without thoughtful balancing. Two easy options are presented to you. It is my hope that the word massacre is used in the lead but how to do it is a hurdle. And add on top of that that we still don't even have a good main title and it shows that this process has been broken since day 1. Day 1 was years ago.  03:16, 28""",[],0

Will the honourable gentleman behind IP 87.67.143.211 post ANY KIND OF SOURCE to back his claim, or will you just continue vandalizing the article and removing content and references? -  

Depardieu is a French actor having his legal residence in Belgium. That's all for the moment

1. France did not remove Depardieu's citizenship yet (otherwise, where is the source?).

2. Depardieu never applied for Russian citizenship.

3. Ask your Prof. of International Law (I did).

4. See here: http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/filmstar-gerard-depardieu-von-putin-zum-russen-ernannt-a-875537.html): “Die Formulierung des Kreml, wonach Depardieu einen Antrag auf Einbürgerung gestellt hatte, wurde von einem Assistenten des Schauspielers dementiert.“

In English: The formulation of the Kremlin, that Depardieu had filed an application for naturalization, was denied by an assistant of the actor.

So yes: the Kremlin lied.

5. Lock this article once and for all for the rest of the month.

6. Ask yourself: If tomorrow, every country of the world offer Depardieu a passport, what do you do? Will you consider he's a Afghanisto-Albanio-Algerio-Andorro-Angolo-Antiguo-Barbudo-Argentino-Armenio-Australio-Austrio-Azerbaijo-Bahamo-Bahro-Banglado-Barbado-Belaro-Belgo-Belizo-Benino-Bhutano-Bolivio-………-Zambio-Zimbabwean actor?

 Havana City vs. Havana City Province 

The source of that confusion is that Havana City Province includes Havana and other cities like Marianao, Santiago de las Vegas, San Miguel del Padron, Regla, Guanabacoa and so on, with their own city halls, institutions, history, etc. Now, it is true that the history, the economy and the social lives of those cities have a strong bond with Havana. For example, Santiago de las Vegas grew because of the importance of the tobacco plantations, Havana had (and still has) tobacco factories. Havana was the most important port of the Spanish Empire in America, and the cities around also enriched because of that fact. Havana's growth swallowed all those cities around, and nowadays they seem to be one and only city, but this is only apparent. Even nowadays, when someone who lives in Marianao borough or district crosses the Almendares River, which is the border, he/she always says """"I'm going to Havana to shop"""". Anyway, you can merge both articles, or write one article for Havana and do the same for the rest of the disctrics.

Simon Baron-Cohen image

Very kindly provided by Simon Baron-Cohen, who is nice he even ran down the photographer for permission. It is Non-free but with permission for fair use.

Image can be resized, moved, cropped and upload as second image (with same permissions) whatever, but thought I'd better pop it up before it gets deleted as an orphan.  

 It's not an orphan, since Simon Baron-Cohen points at it. I'd really rather not have this image in Asperger syndrome, for reasons already discussed. This article already highlights SBC's theories too much, at the expense of other theories that are just as respectable; including his image and omitting other eminent contemporary researchers make the article look more like a puff piece than it did already.  

He actually gave it for this article, so let's try and see what the consensus is? There is no reason why you shouldn't get images of other """"eminent contemporary researchers"""" as well to balance?  
Other editors, such as SandyGeorge, have complained about a lack of images in this article. Delete this one and there is only one small image of Asperger. Zeraeph is right, get more images to balance it, don't just delete.  

Getting more images of other eminent researchers would """"balance"""" the article only in that it would be better to have images of Ehlers, Frith, Gillberg, Happé, Klin, Ozonoff, Rogers, Volkmar, Wing, etc., than having just Baron-Cohen. But this would be changing the article in the wrong direction (not to mention being a source of further disputes). Asperger syndrome should focus on AS, not on AS researchers. With the exception of Asperger himself and maybe Wing, who were instrumental in the history of the disorder, the other researchers just don't make the cut. Rather than head in this direction, the article would be better off stealing the images from Autism. If you take a look at the images in Autism, all but one are far more relevant to AS than this image of Baron-Cohen is.  

I agree with Eubulides. SBC is already over-represented, and the suggestion of increasing focus on the researchers themselves is unnecessary. Maybe a secondary linked article could be created for a 'who's who gallery' of AS researchers (for those attached to this idea).  

I agree with Eubulides and Soulgany101.  Yes, we need images, and there are images that could be used to illustrate AS; SBC isn't one of them, and gives undue weight to one researcher's views.  His image should be used in his article, where anyone curious about him can find it (but the right hand side shoulod be cropped off).   (Talk) 01:""",[],0

""": FOR THE RECORD. Danny, you love to weave more straw men and avoid the real issues at all cost, as you have just beautifully demonstrated. As for me insulting you, it came because of you making provoking insults at me, calling me a """" hog and pig"""" in one of your previous replies on 5 July 2005 15:46 (UTC). If you were using that kind of language with members of the public in the street, you would no doubt be quickly punished and hospitalised for your insulting provocations, and you have also demonstrate why many Jehovah's Witnesses who follow your methods actually incite hate against themselves and their religion due to their shameless insulting and provoking behaviour. You then make more revealing and completely false remarks: """"As Central is fond of pointing out ad hominem arguments are a logical fallacy. By the same token anything he says about me is quite frankly irrelevant to the real issue"""". I pointed out to you, that when I insulted you it did not prove your argumentation wrong (you prove yourself wrong by your manipulative specious methods and lack of any evidence), so therefore, it was not ad hominem at all, but just an insult from your own provoking insults of which you appear to measure by another set of biased scales. Secondly, all the points I have made about your false conclusions and your false logic are all valid as they prove that you are not objective or reasonable at all, and have zero evidence to base your claims on, and are often very slanderous of others (Raymond Franz in this case) with no evidence to back your claims.

YOU Danny Muse, have failed to answer a single point of mine (a typical JW trait), which were about your logical fallacies, your use of slander, your negative propaganda, and your rhetoric. I have asked you again and again for proof of your statements and claims on Franz, and you have dramatically failed on all accounts to bring them on. Here again is the challenge summarized: I herby challenge you to take three different examples from either of Raymond Franz's two books, and prove to us using evidence contained in the books that he is """"a bitter apostate, vindictive liar, makes inaccurate claims, and writes incorrect material about JWs, or the Watch Tower's Governing Body"""" as you claim. If you cannot do this, then you should permanently remove yourself, and be barred from Wikipedia, as you have demonstrated. . . your editing scruples as virtually worthless, and indubitably of no value as a contributor to Wikipedia, as you have proven over and over that you feel content to destroy someone's character (Franz's in this case), his motives, his books, and all without reading a single page of his written material. If someone did the same about Jehovah's Witnesses books, you would be outraged, disgusted, and we would never hear the end to it, you definitely would not stand for it. You would also have utmost contempt for someone who makes up lies, false accusations, and slander about JWs and their books, especially if they had never even read a single JW publication and yet they posted masses of negative claims about them, just like you have about Raymond Franz. YOU Danny Muse, are in NO position to speak, as you have not even read a single book by Raymond Franz, and so have completely and permanently revoked your right to speak, edit, or comment on this matter. . .. If you can bring on proof, then you can have an opinion that the book descriptions are 'this or that' etc., until then all you say is biased POV and unfounded. You have no right to say or edit anything on this particular subject, as you have demonstrated that truth on the matter and literature is not a subject you are interested in. Please read Proverbs 18:13. Posted Central 19 July 2005 (PS. I'm sure you will ignore all this and make up some more straw man to focus on to take the light off your complete lack of evidential backup to your claims about the books and Raymond Franz's character etc. The original book descriptions should stay, as they are brief, to the point, accurate, and give enough information to know the basic book's content.

Tips on vandalizing this article

The best way to complain about a nonexistent, vague plan to do something you can't define is to post your boring opinions on Wikipedia. It doesn't matter that the existence of any """"North American currency union"""" is part of a larger insane conspiracy theory involving Jews, aliens, and Bush doing WTCgo ahead and have a furious debate about something imaginary, muck like two nerds standing outside a comic book store arguing about whether the Hulk can beat up Superman. Under no circumstances should you worry about the war in Iraq, the repressive enforcement of American drug laws, cronyism in the Justice Department, or discrimination against homosexuals in marriage lawsissues with actual relevance to justice and prosperity in America have no place in Fictitious Debate Land. It's important that the people who obsess enough about politics to put unreadable chunks of diarrhea into Wikipedia articles about their pet political theories be the most uninformed and uninsightful people in the world regarding actual political issues.

In all seriousness: there is no North American currency union, there is no plan to create one, the only place it exists is in science fiction. It is unworthy of an article at all, and having one just shows how far Wikipedia is gone into the thrall of conspiracy theorists and obsessive autistic nerds who can't figure out what is and is not important.

I stand by my deletion on the skepticism page. I didn't delete the whole article by any means. I removed the part about false skepticism because it is unprovable and inhereintly doesn't go together. False being the opposite of truth, and skepticism believeing nothing to be certain. To be a false skeptic is impossible to prove and is not a view point but a chance for people to oppose halocaust deniers and such in a biased way on the wiki. I believe that most likely the halocause for example happened, but I am not going to say it is """"false skepticism"""" nor are the """"sources"""" any more reliable or proving anything. So you know how to report better, have better contacts, and tend to have a majority(or enough active members) to back your agenda. Then martyr me and get it over with. It is better to delete it since I legitamately believe it to be unsalvagable and completly opinionated to the point that is pushes a biased agenda. The whole point of the page is for the reader to decide what is skepticism and to go from their. Lets make this more of a history book and less of a language arts book.

And reminding people that citing policy is at best only half the work: you may have settled on what you think governs the issue, but you still need to convince others of the best way to apply it in a particular circumstance.  To do it properly the focus should always be on what the best editorial decision is, not just the superficial level of what complies with codified policy or guidelines.  Yeah, all that should be written down somewhere if it isn't already.  In another guideline for people to cite.  ; )

 Review comments 

I took a brief look at the article after the recent peer review was closed. Here are a few comments for improvement - these are things that woulkd be a problem if this were up for WP:FAC or even WP:GAN.
The lead is five paragraphs but WP:LEAD says the limit is four paragraphs.
The lead does not summarize the article well - my rule of thumb is to include every section in the lead somehow, but the Munic Crisis, his marriage and children, his children with other women, and his death are not in the lead
WP:MOSQUOTE says that all direct quotations need to have a reference (even if they are in the lead)
To be free, most historic images need to have been published before 1923 or their source must be given so clearly that it can be determined that the image was published without a copyright notice or its copyright has expired. Images like File:CAL CAM2 DH4 Nov 4 1926.jpg were clearly taken after 1923, and lack the information as to sources that allow any sort of determination of copyright status.
Or how is this image not still under copyright - published in 1927 at the earliest File:CharlesLindbergh-RaymondOrteig.jpg?
The relevant policy for WP:FAIRUSE images is WP:NFCC, every point of which has to be met for an image to be used under fair use guidelines. I often ask myself three questions about fair use images: 1) Does the image increase the reader's understanding of the article's subject? 2) Is the image discussed in the article itself? 3) Is the image used merely for decorative purposes? NFCC requires minimal use - all of which leads to me to ask: How do two separate Fair Use covers of """"WE"""" increase the reader's understanding / meet minimal use?
MOS says not to sandwich text between images - this does so in several places.
I read Mosely's biography of Lindbergh years ago (it is cited here) and read WE as a kid. This seems to me to under play Lindbergh's isolationism and at least the perception of him as an appeaser / possible Nazi sympathizer. 
The language in the lead at least seems needlessly convoluted - look at what the page Lindbergh says """"Charles Lindbergh (1902–1974), first pilot to fly solo non-stop across the Atlantic"""" then look at how it described here """"As a 25-year-old U.S. Air Mail pilot Lindbergh emerged suddenly from virtual obscurity to instantaneous world fame as the result of his Orteig Prize-winning solo non-stop flight on May 20–21, 1927, made from Roosevelt Field[N 1] located in Garden City on New York's Long Island to Le Bourget Field in Paris, France, a distance of nearly 3,600 statute miles (5,800 km), in the single-seat, single-engine purpose built Ryan monoplane Spirit of St. Louis."""" The facts are all there, but it is so comvoluted that if you don't already know what Lindy did, you might miss it.
What makes """"Charleslindberg.com a reliable source? See WP:RS

 Wondering If You Could Help... 

A couple of months ago, I created a page for the """"Original"""" Clark Sisters, an American close-harmony singing group from the 1930s and '40s, that was fairly well-known at the time.  As an announcer at a Jazz radio station, includng being the host of a """"Trad Jazz"""" show, I have some pretty extensive knowledge of this genre of music.  I properly referenced the article, and provided appropriate links to and from other related pages.  All in all, I think I did a fairly good job, considering it was only my first real page construction.  

So, along comes this editor from the U.K., (""""Seddon""""), and marks the thing for """"speedy deletion"""".  Before I can even find out about it, the page is gone.  Then, when I try to ask him about it by posting on his talk page, he totally ignores me.  In the first place, I can't understand how a U.K. editor is even ALLOWED to edit a piece on U.S. music; secondly, if he is allowed, why is he allowed to place his questionable judgment above mine?  I am hoping that you can help me restore the page, so that I don't have to go to all the trouble of re-creating it, at a loss of several hours of my time.

I'm also wondering about the procedure for filing a complaint against an editor.  It seems to me that his behavior in this matter has not been appropriate, and I wonder if there is any forum that I can take my complaints to?

The information is incomplete and the issue to complex to be simply summed with such a biased quote.

Why want you quote instead  just Stachura who writes about """"Jewish opposition to Polish independence""""? Why not qualify it with Levy, who notes that """"Jews were the victims of thousands of pogroms, dozens of them in Poland""""? Why not use Davies explanation that it was the normal wartime conditions (Polish-Ukrainian War, Polish-Soviet War) and not any targeted antisemitism that led to vast majority of Jewish deaths? Why not quote the contemporary observer, Sir Horace Rumbold, 9th Baronet, who wrote (cited by Davies) that """"the condition [of the Jews] in Poland, bad as it may have been or may still be, has been far better than in most of the surrounding countries""""?

Discography
We should be able to come up with a definitive list of commercially released albums and singles. Let's start with the headings. 

Officially Released
Self Released
Singles
Out of Print Compilations
In Print Compilations

Those should be in sentence case. Do folks agree on those headings? - 

 I think those sound reasonable. I have changed them to sentence case, and re-added the record covers which were deleted from the discography by Jonah. I also re added the descriptions of Rose's musical style that were deleted without explanation. Finally I re-incorporated a new version of the sentence dealing with racism and antisemitism. It makes not direct claims about Rose's online work, only that it deals with race and religion. Then I wrote that this has created a series of accusations of racism and antisemitism in various online chat groups. While online chat groups are not officially a source, the fact remains that these criticisms are out there, posted in various places. I think that this should satisfy both SP (by being NPOV) and Ayers (by bringing up the issue).  Hope this helps. I agree with Will, let's move on.  

I do wonder at the designations of """"self-released"""" vs. """"officially released."""" At what point does one become the other? """"Bone Again"""" and """"Elizabethan Period"""" were funded by people or companies other than Biff, and given professional print runs of a few to several thousand; they were distributed through non-internet indie channels, and reviewed in Mojo magazine.  """"Roast Beef"""" was pressed using Biff's royalties, but then it was picked up by a distributor who slapped their own record label's sticker on the cover; several thousand were produced and sold.  """"Hamburger Blues"""" was an """"official"""" release that may have been a smaller print run than some of Biff's website releases.  """"Uncle Jesus"""" was a major label album that is harder to find than """"Roast Beef."""" """"The Pickwick album was an """"offical"""" compilation of far seedier origin than some of the indie releases.  The whole issue of """"in print"""" vs. """"out of print"""" is a bit difficult to assess as well.  If copies are sealed, stockpiled and available, isn't the album still """"in print""""?

My concern with these categories is that they tend to appear at the same times that text changes are made diminishing Biff's accomplishments; and they seem to be included as part of the intent of that effort.  If you look at other artists' discographies, these distinctions are rarely made.  For example, see Sun_Ra.  A great many of Sun Ra's albums were self-released, including most of the artistic milestones.  It is a vague and misleading designation.  Why not go for straight chronology?

And to confirm Marcuse's interpretation, I was not implying that Marcuse initiated a given edit.  Is someone trying to start fights where they ain't?   

The problem here is that you wrote something, a line that went unsingned, but on closer inspection was found to be added by you but attributed by you to someone esle. You then followed this by saying that you agreed with the line. Very unwiki of you.

Indeed, someone is trying to start fights where they ain't.   

 Wallawe/Jonah, I'm curious what the """"released on cdr"""" that you keep adding to the discography means? What is cdr? As far as the self vs. officially why don't we just simply put """"Full length releases"""" and combine them?  

In most of these cases """"cdr"""" is not an accurate designation.  Some of them were glass-mastered CDs.  But as I said above, I don't think that's too important, anyway.  

, you claimed to revert back to Marcuse, but you did not.  That's a super-misleading tag.  

And now I understand what you are referring to:  .  That's something I do a lot.  It's called """"Paragraphs.""""  Here, I'll do one right now.  Here goes....

The first paragraph was one sentence long and  went: """"Judiasm is targeted"""" is a really problematic phrase.

If you're serious about the sourcing standards that you're arguing for, then please apply them equally to all articles in this topic instead of gunning for subjects that you disagree with. You behavior is entirely inappropriate and enormously damaging to Wikipedia.

I have no idea why Stephan Shulz, Dabelstein, and Will Connolley have been allowed to continue their POV pushing rampage and are free to continue their efforts to disparage those they disagree with by the smearing them in their biographies. I have no objection to the inclusion of properly sourced criticism, but their use of innuendo, and specious arguments for gutting content and coattracking smears is unacceptable. It is very ironic that at a time when a deletion rampage against unreferenced biographies is going on these editors and their admin allies are allowed to violate our core principles and continue to abuse wikipedia for propaganda purposes.

While we can look at a picture at all wavelengths, it is only in the visible spectrum that information on this picture (patterns and variations) start to appear (at other wavelengths, its blank). An analogy would be satellites using SARs to pierce the cloud cover of Venus and image its surface.   There is little information in the visible spectrum but lots outside of it. If the information is encoded in a digital form (eg: RGB) rather than displayed using our technology, then they will interpret it in colors they can see as this encoding is not relative to a specific spectrum.

"(The following is not a formal request to be unblocked)

Thank you AnthonyBradbury your comments made sense. The issues I raised relate to the ANI thread still remaining open. Both Erpert,  NEEnt, and now you as an administrator have said that the matter is 'closed.' 

Despite me being blocked 5 days ago and despite Erpert closing the thread and stating no further comments, another editor whatamidoing, removed that and continued making false, baseless claims, quoting inaccurate details, that easily be proved. Further, entirely separate matters, to what my block was for, are now being discussed 'after' I was blocked. Without me having an opportunity to present clear contrary evidence based purely on the objective editing history. And have a fair minded neutral and independent administrator to judge both sides. 

These editors knew there was a ANI thread, but did not comment for 2 days until I was blocked. After I was blocked they then and only then, stuck the boot in, without any facts to back up their false claims. They may have waited until I was blocked because these baselss claims would have been proven false immediately, through me providing diffs and objective facts to the contrary. In fact, they only ceased when I asked for a temporary unblock above to respond! They would have kept 'hammering away' with baseless false claims, providing no facts to back them up and all the while, me being unable to provide the facts. 

I have made some very solid edits to numerous articles. I respect Wikipedia. I respect Wikipedia's policies. I accept the reasons for my current block and would appreciate, after such a significant period, ie. 2 full weeks, to start afresh and be provided an assumption of good faith in my editing rather than editors judging me already. I think all editors, after being blocked should be given the benefit of the doubt. Not to have this thrown in their face for ever more. That's not right. 

I know a lot about some topics. Very little about other topics. My reliable sources have good. My editing and additions have been good. Productive in many different articles. I completely reject being 'incompetent' as whatamidoing states, without me being able to respond. Simply because of differing points of view. I understand whatamidoing and Bilby are very experienced editors who have made great contributions to Wikipedia as editors. No-one is disputing that. They obviously gain a great deal of enjoyment from the project too! Does that provide these editors 'unequal' rights over less experienced editors who are also adding value to the project? Where they can make false baseless assumptions? I realise I have had some previous conflict with the same small group of editors in the past. But that says nothing about my edits being productive and of benefit to the project. 

I believe strongly in the principles of assuming good faith amongst editors. I did not think blocks were punitive whereby other editors can 'mock' the person who has been blocked? Nor are blocks an opportunity to make false, entirely baseless assumptions about an editor's competence. Is the ANI thread closed or is it not closed please AnthonyBradbury? I am hesitant to ask this through a formal request unblocking request. So could an administrator tell me if this ANI thread that was abruptly re-opened by whatamidoing, after the block was already applied, and the thread closed?",[],0

Firstly, """"fair use"""" does not mean you can just take whatever copyrighted material you like and use it.  Non-free content cannot be used in cases where a free content equivalent, with an acceptable quality sufficient to serve the encyclopedic purpose, is available or could be created.  Lifting a definition from an external source, instead of writing your own, is not an example of fair use.
Secondly, as you seem to think that something can only be redundant if it's an exact copy, let's have a look at the two definitions, piece by piece:
 Wikipedia definition Copied definition Comparison A tax (from the Latin taxo; """"rate"""") is a financial charge or other levy According to Black's Law Dictionary, a tax is a """"pecuniary burden Equivalent in meaningimposed upon a taxpayer (an individual or legal entity)laid upon individuals or property owners Equivalent in meaningby a state or the functional equivalent of a stateto support the government [...] a payment exacted by legislative authority.""""  Equivalent in meaningsuch that failure to pay is punishable by law.It """"is not a voluntary payment or donation, but an enforced contribution, exacted pursuant to legislative authority""""  Equivalent in meaningTaxes are also imposed by many administrative divisions. Taxes consist of direct or indirect taxes and may be paid in money or as its labour equivalent.and is """"any contribution imposed by government [...] whether under the name of toll, tribute, tallage, gabel, impost, duty, custom, excise, subsidy, aid, supply, or other name."""" Oooh!  Slightly different.  And how very useful a list of obscure alternative words for """"tax"""" is too.
If you really, desperately need to include the list of obscure alternative words for """"tax"""", the way to do it is to list some of the terms, and cite the source from which they came.  Simple, huh?  The way not to do it is to copy and paste the entire chunk of text verbatim.
And thirdly, you may be flabbergasted to know that IP addresses are often not static.  The first edit from this IP address is from yesterday.  The first edit from this editor was in 2004.  There is no contradiction there, despite what you seem to want to believe.  201.215.252.50  """,[],0

 Semi-protected edit request on 25 March 2015 

One Direction (commonly abbreviated as 1D) are an English-Irish pop boy band based in London, comprising Niall Horan, Liam Payne, Harry Styles and Louis Tomlinson. Zayn Malik was formerly a member leaving the band on March 25th 2015. They signed with Simon Cowell's record label Syco Records after forming and finishing third in the seventh series of the British televised singing competition The X Factor in 2010. Propelled to international success by social media, One Direction's four albums, Up All Night (2011), Take Me Home (2012), Midnight Memories (2013) and Four (2014) broke records, topped charts in most major markets, and generated hit singles including """"What Makes You Beautiful"""", """"Live While We're Young"""", """"Story of My Life"""" and """"Steal My Girl"""".

Their achievements include five Brit Awards, four MTV Video Music Awards, eleven MTV Europe Music Awards, and nineteen Teen Choice Awards out of nineteen nominations, among many others. According to Nick Gatfield, the chairman and chief executive of Sony Music Entertainment UK, One Direction represented a $50 million business empire by June 2012. They were proclaimed 2012's """"Top New Artist"""" by Billboard. According to the Sunday Times Rich List, by April 2013, they had an estimated personal combined wealth of £25 million ($41.2m) making them the second-wealthiest musicians in the UK under 30 years of age. In 2014, Forbes listed them the second-highest earning celebrities under 30, with the group earning an estimated $75 million from June 2013 to June 2014.""""Justin Bieber is Forbes' highest-earning celebrity under 30 pocketing $80m this year... which should just about cover his costly legal woes"""".

As a fan of John Cena, I am against the hypocrisy of many of his critics for their 'Five Moves Of Doom' comments, especially since many of these people support Hogan, Boogeyman, and Batista, all of whom have not the same in-ring skill as Cena. However, it is absolutely absurd that the Five Moves are repeatedly removed by some mark-out fanboy who doesn't want anything negative said about Cena. The Five Moves are the basis of almost all criticism aimed at Cena, and therefore I have placed them back on the page, although obviously I have rephrased the wording so it is no longer biased against Cena and is entirely factual. Don't remove them again, as that is just stupid and goes against your whole 'no bias' attitude since you're biasing it in favour of Cena while also not letting people know the truth.

"""I have found further evidence related to this big hoax.  

The same user who wrote the Sacred Order of Skull and Crescent Article, and created The Pugilist Club article you cited, is also meddling with the Barbaro Family page.  I found numerous inconsistencies with that SOSC (Sacred Order of Skull and Crescent) article which he attempted to explain away citing unnamed sources, or sources only he claims to have access to. He has edited my personal comments on the discussion page of that article in what appears to me to be an attempt to cover his mistakes.  In the discussion page of his SOSC article he has referenced pugilism, Amelia Earhart, the Wright Brothers, and a letter by Daniel Russell to a Bro. Chase, a letter which is also cited in his article on the alleged Skull and Crescent Order as being one of their prized artifacts.  The citing of this letter was the final straw for me.  I was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt, but when I found that letter quite amazingly and coincidentally while researching Theta Nu Epsilon on ebay of all places, it became clear that the article on the Sacred Order of the Skull and Crescent was founded mainly, if not wholly, on this individual's fantasies.  That letter can still be found on ebay by putting 200101453405, the item number into the ebay search. When I casually conronted the author of the Sacred Order of the Skull and Crescent wikipedia article with this, he initially presented a fantastic notion that perhaps the SOSC members were engaging in the ruse of selling their sacred artifacts to themselves in order to make them look worthless.  When I gave the ebay item number, then he quite suddenly and conveniently recalled that oh yes, he just remembered that in his unavailable source it says they reprinted copies of this letter for their members and that this must be one of those ultra rare reprints.  The buyer (obviously the author of the Skull and Crescent article, The Pugilist Club, and the bastardizer of the Barbaro Family page) left positive feedback for it.  Any dullard can tell an original hand written letter from a copy, if it were a copy negative feedback would have been left. Then upon looking into the publicly available links to items this same person purchased on the online auction site, I found many other fraternity related items as well as Amelia Earhart, Wright Brothers, and pugilism posters! Now I find the author's wikipedia alias is Tiki-Two.  Well, that name is almost exactly what the ebay user who purchased this masonic letter uses! 

I do not know what his motives are, but it seems he (perhaps in conjunction with associates) are building a hoax on wikipedia, possibly as members of a fraternity. It is possible that he is building a collection of items that he intends to present and cite in articles as important artifacts of secret societies.  As a relative outsider to wikipedia, I don't know what course to take, and really don't have the time to find out.  I mainly enjoy reading wikipedia articles, not engaging in what to me is vain online argumentation.  This individual may find and delete this post, but hopefully it will get through to someone at wikipedia who knows what to do.  Wikipedia should not be used to further some publicity stunt or fraternity hoax.  

There is no record anywhere else online of a Vitus Sebastian Barbaro that I can find.  There is no record anywhere else online of The Sacred Order of Skull and Crescent either.  There is no record of a """"Pugilist Club"""" aka """"Fight Club"""" at Purdue anywhere else online.

I think I can help with some explanation here, as metamaterials are not fringe or pseudo science but hard science on the cutting edge of our understanding of chemistry, quantum physics, and engineering. The doppler effect is difficult to understand in terms of metamaterials as it requires one to think in ways which we are not used to. The viewer is stationary, yes, but the photons of light or phonons of sound are moving, and moving though a medium with unique refractive properties.  This means that the wave itself will be curved in bizare ways. One of the effects of this is that the apparent wavelength of the photon or phonon will appear to lower as it approaches, and rise as it recedes from, a viewer.  The infinite inertia refers to the fact that a metamaterial can, in precise circumstances, temporarily halt light by trapping it in the lattice of electromagentic fields within the material or within the particles themselves as a quantum spin state charge. Another way to phrase this would be infintite internal inertia. Such effects have been thoroughly demonstrated, and you can see the article slow light for more information. You are correct in saying that very little in science is infinite, but the catch in a metamaterial is that it is not 'infinite' infinite inertia. The infinite inertia is an induced effect that lasts only as long as the proper conditions remain, whether that be an external current applied to the metamaterial, a temperature to which the material is raised or lowered, or internal quantum state which can be thrown off balance. At the point that these conditions end, the light trapped within the metamaterial is freed from its electromagnetic 'cage' and re-emmited. I hope that I have cleared up some of the misunderstandings about the properties of these materials. rant """,[],0

I guess JFD is trying to discourage you to get in touch with me via e-mail, since he fears some kind of academical threat. Just to clear some things up, I was not the guy who went """"India did not exist until 1947"""". I would never post something as blunt, offensive, and ignorant as that. However, yes, I have changed a few things around as a correction. It is not to offend anyone, but like Kenneth Tennyson and his devoted sidekick JFD (the Green Hornet and Kato), I too have some historical points of views. I understand that you have been accused of being a pan-Indian nationalist, while I have been accused of being a Tamil nationalist. As far as Indian martial arts are concerned, martial arts from both your culture and mine are in the Indian martial arts section. Therefore, it effects both of us.

It seems like through this wiki-conflict, it has thrown us together into one pot. If I am here to put you or your culture down, or to discredit India, why in the first place would I have stuck up for you. I had not intentions in mind when I did that. It just ticked me off when Kenneth sent you that messed up message. Just like, for example, a few years ago, when a Punjabi store owner was beaten up in a hate crime. I was outraged...

I see you have a vast knowledge in the fighting styles of Northern Inda, while I have the same for Southern India. Likewise, you are very knowledgeable about ancient Bharat and its 16 Mahajanapada Republics, while I have the same for ancient Tamilakkam. Since this page on Indian Martial Arts effects us both, maybe together we can combine both our knowledge to present a remarkable page. Yes, I do understand our passions which may sometimes clash. However, if we could set aside some of that and work together in a """"give-take"""" mentality we can make things work.

At the same time, we will present our contributions which may be opposite of what JFD-Kenny think, but at the same time their views shall be presented as well to give a fair and balanced view on Indian Martial Arts.

Do you agree with me on this? If so, it would be nice if we could communicate via e-mail. I have more ideas to share with you. I believe we can make this work. As far as JFD is concerned, I do not know what his intentions are. Maybe he feels a little threatened of the possiblity of you and me teaming up on this project? or maybe I am wrong... Indrancroos

I agree with you that Mansfield probably wouldn't object to the label. He's willing to write a book about manliness, after all! ) But I don't think I'm being oversensitive. I've seen a concerted effort by numerous editors on the Wikipedia to stigmatize various Bush administration officials, and it often involves linking together Leo Strauss, neoconservatism, and the War in Iraq. At one time, I thought the Wikipedia guideline on biographies of living persons required that the subject of articles """"publicly identify with the belief in question"""" (at least I thought it did although I can't find the relevant passage now) and I assumed that's why the comment in the article said """"Mansfield has self identified as a Straussian."""" So when I downloaded the interview and it turned out that it did not substantiate the claim, I changed the language without changing the substance. There are so many conspiracy theories out there about Leo Strauss and the War in Iraq (see G-hits for the search terms [""""Leo Strauss"""" War Iraq]) that I tend to be vigilant with notable students of Leo Strauss, since the word """"Straussian"""" has been highjacked by critics and used pejoritively. Is there a reason you feel strongly about using the word """"Straussian""""?

Please read the tag at the top of the page.  The name is under dispute.  

 Moved the Page Move Protection tag to talk page 

There isn't really a need for the tag to be on the article itself. As was successfully argued regarding the """"dispute tag"""" previously, the tag itself doesn't help the article, and it being on the talk page achieves the same end.  

Having a warning on the front page shows that the article is in a state of flux.  Anyone who isn't particularly wiki-savvy wouldn't realize that there is an ongoing dispute and that the current version may well change in the near future.  The """"non-endorsement"""" of the current name of the article is a reasonable point to make.  I don't particularly care for either name, but making it look stable when it's unclear is kind of misleading to the reader.  

You're not making a lot of sense. The first sentence of the article notes the naming of the country. I believe you were involved with the discussion regarding the """"Dispute"""" tag, and it came to the point where the only sensible solution was to have it on the talk page. The same applies with this tag. It has nothing to do with honesty and I'd be insulted if I didn't assume good faith. Please reconsider your reversion, the last thing I want is an edit war of any sort.  

Look at the discussion on this page regarding the name dispute tag.  I wouldn't say that there was a consensus that removing the tag was the only """"sensible solution"""".
The statement is true and not misleading.  Neither staying nor moving are WP:SNOWBALL.
Protection tags are usually on the front page of the article.  See WP:PROTECT#Other_notes for talk page templates.
The tag deflects mastodons: Having the tag on the article itself sends a clear message to people who might just assume that the name is wrong and move it.
The tag shows that the current name of the article is not a consensus statement: Not having the tag implies to a casual reader that the current name is appropriate (not the current consensus because there is no consensus).
It seems kind of redundant to you or me since we've been staring at it for the last couple of weeks, but to someone who is not already involved it shows that the article is not stable.  I mean, I really don't care that much, but why is it so critical to take it off?

Now, related to the 2nd one, what do you think about:
While Vargas and the military leadership were supposed to assume the government temporarily to implement democratic reforms related to 1891's Constitution, they instead closed the Congress and ruled with emergency powers, replacing the states' governors with their supporters. With the non fulfillment of promised democratic reforms, in 1932 the oligarchy of São Paulo tried to regain the power, as well as in 1935 the Communists rebelled, having both been defeated. Using the communist threat as an excuse, Vargas and military preclude elections, launching a coup d'état in 1937, formalizing the then dictatorship. In May 1938, there was another failed attempt to take over the power by local fascists.

 Original Research/Other 

The article mentions some details about the combos, as well as character storylines.  Although these things do seem accurate, a lot of material seems to have been written by someone familiar with the game and doesn't cite the source.  Perhaps a simple sentence, like """"The arcade included the following descriptions"""" would be more precise.  Meltdown's name is probably able to be cited from a Nintendo Power.

Winning the game with Eyedol does have an ending storyline that clearly parodies Blanka from Street Fighter II.  Another note is that the SNES version had a different ending (saying something about Eyedol's bracelet) whereas the arcade version mentioned the club.

Some notable game play features: I think the sky stage is perhaps noteworthy, as it could lead to some very short games on the arcade (although the Tekken series was known to have even faster fights).  Also, in the arcade Eyedol had a notably easy infinite combo (when the opponent was at the edge of a stage), plus a much more difficult infinite combo (running back and forth), and the SNES version didn't have these things.

The comment above about tapping a low button might be referring to the easy repeatable combos in KI2, which would be another game.

KI1 and KI2 used the exact same motherboard (the model # / name / whatever was identical on both motherboards), and the software was different only by the chips installed in the motherboard and the hard drive.  (Surprising, perhaps, considering how different the games graphical feels look from each other.)  These games used the Ultra 64 hardware, which was the correct name for the hardware at the time of KI1's release.  Rare had said (in some unofficial strategy guide) that they had no concerns/reason-to-worry about KI Gold matching the performance of KI2, making some smart remark about those concerns only being needed when moving to a less powerful machine.  (KI Gold was initially also going to have more characters, but the memory limitations of the cartridge later proved to prevent this.)  Therefore, it's not out of line to think that the N64 is really significantly different than the Ultra 64, other than the lack of the hard drive.  Cruisin' USA is known to use some other motherboard, and reference the Ultra 64 just as an unrelated advertisement.

Bugs in the game could probably get their own section, including Orchid's attacking after turning into a frog, opponents shrinking with Thunder's combo, Riptor being unable to get a high hitting combo when the Ultra misses, and the fight being able to continue on after Orchid initiates her Ultra (if initiated after hitting the opponent into the air and then backflipping, and having the opponent hit her out of the Ultra).""",[],0

""":I'm not sure what all the issues have been with your edits and the rest of the community. As best as I can determine, the issues are 1) use of code share in lead & 2) changing tense """"is"""" to """"was"""" (based on this edit). In regards to Wikipedia:AVINAME, the guideline is the following (abridged for clarity): 
""""Where an aviation incident article...begins with the opening sentence: Airline Flight XYZ...., it should go on to immediately describe the notability of the incident in as few as words as possible. For this reason, it is not necessary in the opening line to clarify that the flight number may still be in use, or where it is normally scheduled to fly - this is because the normal flight or flight number is not the subject of the article...For example: Madeup Airway Flight 123 was a passenger flight from Somewhere to Somewhere Else, that on such and such a day, failed/crashed/blew up/was hijacked. [correct]"""" 
I think the important part of the guideline is what I italicized. I think the code share is important, especially given the media coverage focusing on the men traveling on stolen passports. Whether or not that belongs in the lead doesn't matter to me...it could be a separate sentence or mentioned in the """"incident"""" section. Take a look at the example given in the guideline—Air Florida Flight 90—and the recent high-profile, highly-edited article Air France flight 447. Both use two sentences, first being to state the origin/destination and the second stating the aircraft & what happened. I don't think there needs to be a reference to the men using stolen passports, as officials do not believe they have links to terrorism. It's also difficult to write about the significance of the flight without referencing it as """"crashed"""", per Wikipedia policies. Taking into account what I said, here is a proposal for the lead:

If an official would just refer to the plane as """"presumed crashed"""", then the following could be added as a second paragraph in the lead:

""""I think we probably share the view that the 'energy comparison' section is poorly written and sourced."""" - we can agree on that, but i would make the point that we should make the best of what we have until better information/models become available.

""""my problem with the AGA document is that it's very misleading and should not be included for that reason""""  - my answer is that the document does not really contain errors but contains some spin as you would expect from the manufacture however the spin is obvious and most people would be able to extract useful information from it despite its flaws. I would argue that reference 3 is also misleading as the data models presented there are to simplistic and will mislead people so using you own argument if you exclude reference 5 then you should also exclude reference 3. Energy models are inherently complex beasts and very simple representations such as 3 contribute nothing but confusion to the debate.

""""Your complaint about a supposed 'Green rant' indicates that you do not have a neutral view"""" - you are reading to much into that comment. Its a response to the fact that the media that I read seems to be full of half baked green ideas which don't add up either from a technical or a mathematical point of view. As a trained engineer I am only interested in arguments that make sense from a technical view not fantasy land arguments that seem to require 1+1 to = something other than 2!

If you read the comment is fee website where Monobiot writes you will see something like 5 to 7 pages of comment on his article almost all critical about his article. The most common one was that he was not comparing like with like. Monobiot makes a lot of interesting points ( I have just read his book HEAT) but when it comes to technical details he is out of his depth and frequently gets things wrong. Read the site for more detail.  

""""But do you not see the difference between marketing spin by AGA, and reliable, referenced data?"""" - yes of course - so provide some - I dont think this article cirrently contain any. It contains information but i dont think is very good information. 

""""For example, you have plucked a figure of 30 years out of somewhere"""" its either in that article or another one on the AGA or Rayburn web sites. When considering some of the costs you have to remember that AGA last a very long time 
so costs and gains have to be considered over a longer time scale than you would for a cheap chinese electric oven which would have to be replaced 3-4 times over the same period.

""""conventional ovens is worse than dismal"""" - I don't agree that that has been proven, the indications are that it is not very good in some circumstances but i think that dismal is to hard a term and yet to be proven. You cant consider thenal devices such as a AGA without considering how they are used. For instance consider 2 AGA , a 2 oven model in a single person household and a 4 Oven model in a nursing home. The first would be a disaster preparing maby only one hot meal a day, while the other would be on the go 24x7x365. Both are AGA, the first setup would be crazy, the second is a market that actually buys large numbers of AGA and they are commercial institutions for the most part, they are run by hard nosed managers and yet they buy tons of AGA why is that if they are as bad as you say? What do you know that all these hard nosed money pinchers don't? I suspect that answering the question for the AGA is very much more than straight KwH

BYW I dont have an AGA or expect to ever own one - I am interested in engineering soultions to global warming ( real solutions not 10:10 stuff) but i dont understand why this whole """"lets bash teh AGA"""" thing that seems to be going on at the moment is coming from?

According to your logic, reverting vandalism would be disruptive too, and should lead to blocking.  I think the problem here is that, like many admins, you barely contribute to Wikipedia, and care little about its content.  You are mainly a janitor and policeman, and tend to develop a janitor's and a policeman's attitude.  It is an issue of systemic bias.  Ordinary users tend to have an editor's attitude, i.e. their priority is making articles as good as possible, and not accept other people's bad edits.

Your mention of discussion on talk pages is fantasy.  Oh, I do of course discuss matters on talk pages at great length (look at this for example), but I am under no illusions that people like you or Eiorgiomugini will be swayed by any amount of logical argument.  At the end of the day, the only way that editors can make sure that articles have good content and not bad content is by inserting good content and removing bad content.  This is my observation after long examination of Wikipedia.

In the specific case of me versus Eiorgio, your mention of discussion is also a straw man because you are trying to imply that I only discussed in the edit summaries.  In reality, I tried to reason with him on his talk page, but he simply deleted all my comments, showing he had no interest in debating it.

Your mention of sockpuppetry is fantasy and a straw man.  Please do not introduce irrelevant, insulting concepts into the discussion.  With as much validity, I could warn you to make sure that Tawker is not your (good-cop/bad-cop) sockpuppet.

I take it you will have to look more in the area of Madison Grant, Charles Davenport, Henry Ford, and all the other nice American industrialists who wrote most of the eugenic literature in the early 20th century.

Charles Davenport even received a letter from a Jewish member of some editorial board concerning a racial hygiene board - previously this Jewish doctor had been considered for an editorial role on some German racial hygiene theory - but guess what - the Nazis didn't tell him he was soon about to become 'racially unfit' too. Talk about having some of your own medicine. Anyway, he wrote a letter to Charles Davenport pleading for him to denounce the Nazis' action. Guess what - not only did he NOT REPLY, but he also had leading positions on that same German magazine's editorial board a year later.

It's a really hot day here in the UK after a series of hot days and my mind is not working clearly. I'm not sure what you're asking me. I think you're talking about Category:Beverage companies, and how breweries end up there. At some point that has been organised thus - Category:Beverage companies - Category:Alcoholic beverage companies - Category:Beer and breweries by region - Category:Beer and breweries in North America - Category:Beer and breweries in the United States - Category:Beer and breweries in Alabama. The brewing companies are contained within each """"Beer and breweries in Foo"""" cat. What you are proposing is the same thing as already exists, but separating the companies from the brands at a low level, and then having two cats - one of products and one of companies, running side by side up the tree. What I am saying is that is not needed and is unwanted. We'd like to keep the beer and the brewery together in the same multi-purpose cat. Beer and brewery are often related. Bass and Heneiken, for example, refer both to product and company. Where possible we deal with both product and company in the same article, though with notable examples we will split off the product into its own standalone article.

"Kimberly Billett 

While first reading this article I was slightly overwhelmed with the amount of information. However as the article progressed, I continued to see an increasing amount of methods (both right and wrong) that I recognized from first hand experience. Throughout high school I was continuously asked to tutor children (typically students between first and fourth grade) and so one of the most commonly used methods was the additive method. The children I tutored, especially the younger ones, found it difficult to distinguish when to use the multiplicative method versus the additive method. Originally I found this frustrating but reading this article, and in particular the section on the ‘Mr. Short and Mr. Tall’ experiment, made it clear as to why the kids didn’t understand. 

I am also studying astronomy in which we are studying Newton’s universal law of gravitation and hence this was one of the more interesting and appealing sections of the article for me. That being said, I think the author could have expanded upon this example by describing, for instance, the inverse square law in which tripling the distance between the objects would weaken the force of gravity by 3^2 and explaining so people who haven’t covered the subject would understand.",[],0

 Ward Churchill is Not An Indian 
I am an enrolled member of Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma and I used to work for the BIA. I added into the article the written opinions of people that have researched Churchill's Indian ancestry and 99% of these Indian folks point out that Churchill has not provided the basic information required to prove that he is an Indian. I put it up last night and it much of it was taken down early this morning. It was information where I provided sources for the comments. I understand that what I wrote can and should be edited. But taking out information that provides sources and citations seems to be an attempt to stifle the information. Dear Fred Bauder, it IS fair to ask if Churchill really is an Indian. He is taking away from actual Indian people the ability to speak for themselves. He has build his whole career on being someone who has experienced the oppression of a minority culture. It is similar to a white middle class Protestant person from Idaho was writing books about himself being a Jew in Hitler's Germany. And don't even say that I just made a inaccurate analogy because Churchill himself compares and uses Hitler and Nazi analogies. I'm sure that is how you learned about him in the first place because he made this most recent comment about 9/11 victims are all """"Eichmann's."""" Look, providing information about whether you are an Indian or not should not be that difficult. Why? You have Indian parents. It is simple as that. Even if you don't have brothers and sisters then you have Indian parents and your parents have brothers and sisters. Correct? Why doesn't anyone in Indian Country know any of these people? This is NOT a cheap shot as you indicated above. It goes to the heart of who he claims that he is. As Suzan Harjo pointed out: Churchill is taking jobs and speaking engagements from real actual Indians and building a whole career on it. Those jobs and speaking engagements should go to actual Indian. Also, Harjo made the point that Churchill's comments are having a backlash and where is that backlash going? On to Indian Country. Look, no one believes that he should not have the right to say what he wants. We all believe in the First Amendment even if it is difficult speech. However, just don't run around and claim that you are an Indian when you aren't and that you personally have been oppressed. Let's say that I am a white person that lives in Kentucky and I attend a Baptist church and my parents came the United States from South Africa, do you really believe that I could run around and write books on Irish experience of oppression in Belfast? No. But that is what he is doing. And you are calling it a cheap shot. It is not a cheap shot. It goes to who and what he is. He is what we call in Indian Country a Wannabee. There is a whole tribe of Indians called the Wannabee Indians and he is the Chief. The people that making the complaints about his fake Indian heritage are not conservatives by any stretch of the imagination either: Suzan Harjo (worked for Bill Clinton), Dennis Banks (Founder of the American Indian Movement), etc. He can say wherever he wants about 9/11 or America, but he shouldn't lie and claim that he is an Indian when he isn't. And schools like the Univ of Colorado should do a better job of doing there homework when they hire a someone and put out to the world that he is an Indian because he isn't.Keetoowah 17:45, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)""",[],0

 Dubious sentence 

""""Consequently, Ney now organised a combined arms (infantry, artillery and cavalry) attack on La Haye Sainte, which fell as the defending King's German Legion troops ran out of ammunition. Ney then moved artillery up to the allied centre and began to pulverise the infantry squares.[73]""""

This is the final sentence of the French Cavalry attack section.

There seem to be several things wrong with it: first, attacking a building with cavalry is pointless, be they with infantry or not, second, field artillery have little effect on reasonably stout (like Belgian farmhouses) buildings, apart from shells setting them alight (which is what happened to the Chateau de Goumont, to little effect).

I think two events are being conflated here.  

Having become obvious that the cavalry on their own were achieving little, Ney organised a combined arms attack, using Bachelu's Division (Reille's Corps) and the remaining French cavalry in a fit enough state, towards the centre of Wellington's position, this was halted by the Household Brigade cavalry led by Uxbridge (who couldn't break the French infantry formations, and consequently the British cavalry then fell back). Uxbridge then tried to lead the Dutch-Belgian heavy cavalry into the attack but they refused to charge.  Meanwhile, Bachelu's men and their cavalry supports were being hard hit by artillery fire and eventually fell back themselves.  

Simultaneously, or thereabouts, elements of D'Erlon's Corps renewed the attack on La Haye Sainte, and were ultimately successful.

 

If you can reference all of that, be bold and put it in! - 

 Done (I'm bloody, bold and resolute - in Shakespeare's words ;)  ) 

 Artillery 

One omission and one challenge. 

We should say something about Wellington's tactic of having his gun crews seek shelter in the infantry squares during the cavalry attacks. There is also Mercer's account of not doing so because he reckoned if his men ran for the Brunswick squares next to them, the Brunswickers would run too. He gives a great eyewitness account of what happened to cuirassiers when you fired canister at them at point-blank range, too. 

Now the challenge. What's the source for there being only 54 guns in the Grand Battery? French """"batteries"""" (field brigades, or companies, perhaps, more correctly) had eight guns. There should have been either 48 or 56, i.e. 6 or 7 batteries, as otherwise it would imply at least one incomplete unit, or that some weapons were detached for some reason. I don't recall any suggestion from elsewhere that that happened. Were there perhaps 54 guns east of the Brussels road?  

Adkin, p. 296, has forty two 6lb, eighteen 12lb cannon, and six 6in and fourteen 5.5in howitzers - eighty pieces of ordnance in total from 10 artillery companies (of 8 pieces each).  This is for the period 1:00 to 1:30 pm.

6th Foot Artillery: 9th, 10th, 11th, 19th and 20th companies

8th                4th company

2nd                7th company

Marines of the Guard Foot Artillery: 2 companies (undifferentiated)

Old Guard Foot Artillery: 6th company.

 

Thanks - and those figures are consistent with what I know of French artillery organisation, i.e. each 8-gun foot artillery company had 6 guns and two howitzers. Your source shows 20 howitzers in total which says they had the howitzers of 10 companies, hence 80 guns - so it ties in. The eighteen 12-pounders would be the guns of three companies and the six 6in howitzers would have been theirs.

I wonder if someone miscounted by adding up just the guns and forgot to include the howitzers? That would get you close to 54 guns. Or perhaps 54 guns is what they had left after the Union Brigade got done with them.  

I vote we change it. At present the article implies that there was a 54-gun battery which covered the entire length of Wellington's position, and that this dilution of fire accounted for its relative ineffectiveness.  

By all means change it.

I hope that you might also realise that if in your words the case here is """"thankfully relatively rare"""", why many people would then think that applying a blanket measure such as Flagged Revisions is not very appropriate at all.

 By Mordechai Bar-On], from Michael Oren's article on the Six Day War is cited repeatedly in this article, and in the lead. Oren traces """"The Path to War"""" from November 1966 (starting on page 134) and on page 135 mentions the armed clashes along the Israeli-Syrian border, the fact that the Israeli forces gained dominance over the (so-called) demilitarized zones, and the large November 1966 IDF attack on the West Bank village of Samu. He claims that Nasser began looking for a means of ridding himself of UNEF after King Husseien criticised him for failing to defend the West Bank, while hiding behind the skirts of UNEF. You can't rely on a source that confirms the path to war, while at the same time deleting the entire section that describes the Syrian border clashes and IDF activities in the demilitarized zone.

The paragraph should be strictly about what he did or didn't during his political life. Again, I think, we should be extremely careful about striking the right contextual balance.

""", 21 July 2015 (UTC)
 Sure.  So in this particular case, here is what I found.  You've been name-dropped in WaPo.  Usually, that would make you an auto-implied-endorsement... but rather than being 'strategist' or some kind of 'senior advisor' or whatever, your job title was CTO... somewhat strange for a political campaign to *have* somebody with that job-title.  Hence, I didn't count it as an auto-implied-endorsement, but looked further.  This is relatively unambiguous:  
 Ron Schnell, computer programmerhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/06/30/supreme-court-passes-on-google-oracle-case-rand-pauls-campaign-hosts-a-hackathon/ at NSUhttp://cec.nova.edu/faculty/adjlist.html 
 But there is some wiggle room, there.  And thus, the question is:  1) per WP:ABOUTSELF, is that a public endorsement, by a """"celebrity programmer"""" of sorts?  or alternatively, is that a public endorsement, by a """"celebrity professor"""" of sorts?  I originally put you down as a prof, because of your earliest press being for NYU, and your current job being adjunct prof, and your years at Syracuse.  You have obviously been a programmer, but you've also obviously been in academia (of one type or another ... sysadmin at ITS counts in my book) for a very long time.  Paul has specific platform-planks that impact the world of computer science, and the computer industry:  net neutrality, NSA data-collection, and more.  There are likely to be copyright-related issues in the 2016 election (cf the oracle-vs-google lawsuit over whether the fundefs in an API are """"copyright"""" or rather """"fair use"""" in terms of Java libcalls  this is probably more important than the look and feel lawsuits of the 1980s).  So, I could see a case where as a programmer-slash-professor, you would endorse based on your understanding of the economic impact in the computer industry, much like Walter Block endorsed as an academic who is an economics prof (despite disagreeing with Paul on specific issues like the correct governmental level for dealing with vaccinations  they agree on economics and thus Block endorsed).  Then there is the third possibility, which is the endorsement as a staffer.  Although you are a new face as a political consultant, that doesn't necessarily make a staffer-endorsement less valuable; in some ways, it makes your endorsement more wiki-noteworthy, because you *are* an outsider, who wasn't hired based on your implied-and-pre-existing endorsement, like most of the professional-political-staffer-hires tend to be.  
       Finally, I will point out that per WP:BLP, wikipedians are pretty careful when making statements about BLPs, yourself included, as well as Rand Paul.  It is 'saying something' about Paul when somebody is listed as endorsing him, but even more so, it is 'saying something' about you when we list you as an endorsement-giver.  Since this is a borderline case, wikipedians usually just defer to what the BLP wants to happen (in this case you).  If you want to be listed as an endorsement-giver, because it is a true statement, per WP:COI you should not insert yourself.  But I already inserted you, along with a ton of other staffer-endorsements (most of the implied variety but one or two that were more carefully quotation-laden).  And that was before we became wiki-involved during the AfD of the Dunnet videogame, so it still stands an the action of an uninvolved editor.  In other words, if you'd rather be left off the list, that's fine, just say so, and why.  If somebody else inserts you into the article, don't remove yourself from the article-mainspace, per wiki-COI behavioral rule#1, but instead ask for assistance.  It will also help if you post something WP:ABOUTSELF to your blog, which says that you are not yet formally endorsing any candidate in the race, although that's not necessary at present (only if some other editor re-inserts you).  On the other hand, if after reading this, and looking over the list at Endorsements for the Republican Party presidential primaries, 2016, you end up deciding that you do belong on the list (either under the academia-subsection or under the ce",[],0

 Autograph Pages. 

I saw your message on ANNAfoxlover's talk page. Tell me, what do you think should be done with all the autograph books? I'm probably sounding zealous, but I would like to see them deleted. They don't seem to be of any use to Wikipedia. Sure, my own subpages don't help Wikipedia much, but at least they are of some use. Autograph books sound like the sort of thing you have to sign when going into a fancy restaurant to show that you ate there (not a brilliant analogy, but it's reasonable).  

I shouldn't comment since I just launched an alternative site for autograph books but the reason I did that was because I strongly suspect these will be deleted from Wikipedia - but not by me. .

As wiki states prog metal is """"Progressive metal is a genre of heavy metal music which shares traits with progressive rock including use of complex compositional structures, odd time signatures, and intricate instrumental playing. The high level of musical proficiency is often combined with a lyrical counterpart in the form of epic textual concepts, resulting in lengthy songs and concept albums. As a result of these factors, progressive metal is rarely heard on mainstream radio and video programs, much due to that the length of the songs are not suited for those medias.""""

[edit] BiographyCuban was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania[6][7] and grew up in the Pittsburgh suburb of Mt. Lebanon, in a Jewish[8] working-class family. His last name was shortened from """"Chabenisky"""" when his Russian grandparents landed on Ellis Island.[9] Cuban's father Norton was an automobile upholsterer.[6][10][11] Cuban's first step into the business world occurred at age 12, when he sold garbage bags to pay for a pair of expensive basketball shoes.[6][12] While in school, he held a variety of jobs, including bartender, disco dancing instructor, and party promoter. He paid for college by collecting and selling stamps, and once gained about $1,100 from starting a chain letter.[6]

Rather than attending high school for his senior year, Cuban enrolled as a full time student at the University of Pittsburgh. After one year at the University of Pittsburgh, he transferred to Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana and graduated in 1981 with a bachelor's degree in business administration.[13]

[edit] FamilyIn September 2002, Cuban married Tiffany Stewart, an advertising executive, in Barbados,[14] with a wedding reception at the American Airlines Center. Their first daughter, Alexis Sofia, was born on September 25, 2005; their second daughter, Alyssa, was born in 2007.[15] Tiffany and Mark also have a son born in early 2010.[2] The family lives in the Preston Hollow area of Dallas, in a 24,000-square-foot (2,200 m2) mansion.[16]

[edit] Early careerIn 1982, Cuban moved to Dallas, Texas. Cuban first found work as a bartender,[17][18] then as a salesperson for Your Business Software, one of the first PC software retailers in Dallas. He was terminated less than a year later, after meeting with a client to procure new business instead of opening the store.[19]

Cuban started a company, MicroSolutions, with support from his previous customers from Your Business Software. MicroSolutions was initially a system integrator and software reseller. The company was an early proponent of technologies such as Carbon Copy, Lotus Notes, and CompuServe.[20] One of the company's largest clients was Perot Systems.[21] In 1990, Cuban sold MicroSolutions to CompuServe—then a subsidiary of H&R; Block—for $6 million.[22] He retained approximately $2 million after taxes on the deal.[23]

In 1995, Cuban and fellow Indiana University alumnus Todd Wagner started Audionet, combining their mutual interest in college basketball and webcasting. With a single server and an ISDN line,[24] Audionet became Broadcast.com in 1998. By 1999, Broadcast.com had grown to 330 employees and $13.5 million in revenue for the second quarter.[25] In 1999, during the dot com boom, Broadcast.com was acquired by Yahoo! for $5.9 billion in Yahoo! stock.[26]

[edit] Business careerAfter the sale of Broadcast.com, Cuban diversified his wealth to avoid exposure to a market crash.[27] As of 2011, Cuban is No. 459 on Forbes' list of """"World's Richest People"""", with a net worth of $2.5 billion.[28] The Guinness Book of Records credits Cuban with the """"largest single e-commerce transaction"""", after he paid $40",[],0

Have you heard of Ševčenko's law? One hundred and fifty years, or more, of """"serious"""" history and good old Dan's dog is the first to pick this tree. 
From what I understood of it, and it's rather over my head, Mc Carthy has a point. However, it would be throwing the baby out with the bathwater to adopt his dates before anyone else does. It means that every date in a book needs to be Mc Carthy-ised. 
And even then I have very serious doubts about the accuracy of the results. Mc Carthy's method may give accurate AD dates, but I suspect there are problems. Take 763. He's content to put Domnall Midi's death in that year, just as the historians are, but why does AD 763 start with an event dated to 20 November? Fair enough, that could just be a glitch from the compilation, but it could also be that whatever the source was, its years did not start on 1 January or March 25 but instead on 1 September. Adding that to an article would be WP:OR, so we won't do that - we do when it's Bede's years because people have discussed it in print, but this they haven't - but we can take it into consideration here when deciding what to do. 
The Chronicle of Ireland was compiled from lots of sources and it would be a reasonable bet that even if most or nearly all of them started the year on 1 January, some would have done so on 25 December, some on 1 September, and some on 25 March. Even if Mc Carthy's system is perfect, you can only be entirely confident about the year if the event falls between 25 March and 31 August.
If we can date events to within a year either way, that's good, if we can date events in the 7th century to within 2 or 3 years, that's marvellous. If it were me, I'd go with """"historian"""" dates, i.e. what Byrne, Charles-Edwards and the rest say, and add Mc Carthy's corrections in a footnote, which is what is done with Penda of Mercia and other C7th Anglo-Saxons where there is a similar, but smaller, problem.

 Locations 
Thailand.
While Phuket is a more popular and well known general tourist location in Thailand that includes sex tourism.  Pattaya is clearly a location that is dedicated almost exclusively to sex tourism.  I dont know Phuket that well but well enough it is bigger but probably has alot more non-sex tourists so if I were going to identify a place in Thailand if not the world I would mention Pattaya instead and I am tempted to edit.  I hazard a good guess that on any day there is much more """"sex for money"""" going on in Pattaya than Phuket. But for someone considering the phrase """"sex tourism"""" as not necessarily pejorative I have to qualify this conclusion.  
Note that """"bar girls"""" in Thailand never refer to themselves as prostitutes and this probably goes for most of the general Thai population also.  Although I beleive that there are words in Thai for prostitute they mostly (at least the girls) prefer to call themselves """"rented wifes"""" albeit for """"short time"""" rather then """"long time"""".  I therefore need to be qualify my Pattaya versus Phuket statistic in order to be accurate as excluding sex between husbands and  rented wifes particularly of the """"long-term"""" married western kind that typically eventually end up with a large exchange of capital in the """"wifes"""" direction whether during the marriage or at its end or both.  There is no such thing as a free lunch and """"everybody pays for it"""". 
[Note that I neither intend nor consider any of the former comments to be either sexist (note women still get paid less than men and suffer loss of income during pregnancy and child rearing) and moreover consider them culturally aware (particurlay Thailand wise).  The fact is that almost all relationships of a sexual kind are commercial ones! One must be aware that labels, concepts, ideas such as """"sex tourism"""" carry suggestions associated with Religion particularly Judeo-Christiam-Islamic (JDI) pejoratives thst underpin much of western if not most of the (Religious) worlds worldviews outside of some tribal, village, usually Buddhist and what I like to call """"Giesha cultures"""": e.g. Japan, Thailand etc, versus """"Virgin cultures"""" typically (JDI) that often revolve around even int he west to some extend the worhship and praise of female virginity before marriage. (Note that Thai Society is strangely contradictory in this regard  aren't we all!  but then Thai culture too has a long and more recent tradition of polygamy than the west.)  Perhaps some historio-religious criticism of these sorts o pejorative and cultural factors should be entertained in the article proper also.  I hate value laden western (and Religious) labels that dress themselves up psuedo-scientificly as culturally universal. Exploitation of the child aside their is vastly more """"exploitation"""" going on outside of the sex busniess in the third world under global capitalism like Chinese factories where labourers - girls included - work excruciating long hours for a few Yuan or RMB.]

"As Roland perceptively noted, Sand's book is not so much propositive of a theory, as deconstructive of theories about a people. The most invaluable part of the book consists of a perfectly normal historian's history, i.e., of the socio-ideological forces influencing the construction of a modern collective Jewish identity. In this I am reminded of Martin Bernal. His propositive theory, which however took up far more space than Sand dedicates to the Khazars, was almost self-evidently silly. But his analysis in volume 1 of the modern historiography of ancient Greece as that was influenced by racial theory, is still regarded as a tour de force. One doesn't throw the baby out with the barfwater. As to genetics, Sand himself deals with that pp.273ff., and in so far as RS reviews challenge him on this, they cannot be excluded, even if, it's just a personal view, many of those reviews are incompetent and show a lack of familiarity with the book. The criterion should be, genetic criticism or evaluation of Sand should be admitted if Sand's book is specifically targeted or mentioned by those papers, and ignored if not.

Hello,

I always welcome feedback for my efforts, most of which nowadays are editing and writing narrative nonfiction and novels.

And I do appreciate those who have studied the art and science of the English language, esp. grammar and usage. 

I especially love it when those who would criticize another's work do it decently and respectfully.

Having listened to the tone, color and texture of your message, I assume that you're not one of those I describe in paragraph two above. Further, I assume you're not diplomatic in your dealings with other people, in general. Either that, or you're just plain too lazy to be kind and decent. 

Telling me I'm """"wrong"""" is just plain rude, esp. when BOTH of us are correct, according to modern-day usage.

By the way, the correct way your sentence should've been structured is, """"No, you're wrong; it's perfectly acceptable."""" Of course, I may've said something like, """"You're both right, Dean. Happy editing and thank you for contributing to Wkipedia.""""

Of course, that's just I . . . or me, as it were. . . .

I wish you well in your future edits.

Take care,

Mmmm, this is a tricky issue. The debate as I see it is between providing a useful article for readers desiring information not otherwise contained in Wikipedia, and providing something basically inaccurate. For example, Brooklyn Beckham (the son of footballer David Beckham) was deemed not notable enough to merit his own Wikipedia article. Hence the link from Brooklyn Beckham redirects to the """"Personal life"""" section of his dad's article. Not strictly accurate, but probably the most useful link for people who want to know about Brooklyn. In the absence of an article about Gadara (Umm Qais), if there was no other article related to Gadara, the same might apply to the redirect to Legion (demon).

www.zimbeckchess.com is where this was sourced. It was deemed unreliable because the random guy that edited wanted to war with me because he did not like what I said when I said I felt the Halloween was """"Playable"""". Don't dare play this line anyone! Someone will play this dusty Kaufman line and win a pawn by force!!! Kaufman the all knowing all seeing eye atop the pyramid and Euwe and 100 year old player who would not even be able to beat my laptop in chess. Beware the innocuous PINSKI REFUTATION THAT IS NOT REALLY A REFUTATION

Maybe if I was Carlsen this guy would stop undoing my edits and saying my """"personal website"""" was unreliable. Or maybe not! Maybe Carlsen can not edit Wikipedia. Maybe this is Carlsen in disguise!! Think of how many people RELY on wikipedia. People RELY on experts in their fiedls. But what happens when the experts get ignored?! I guess my master title in chess is toilet paper. So are my chess puzzles. My """"self-published"""" book is probably garbage. Maybe I should delete my """"personal"""" website because its not Krabbes site which this guy likes better because he likes Krabbe better than Zimbeck. In his eyes, judging Zimbeck by one comment made about the opening being playable. What this guy does not know, is theory changes and thats why they call it theory. OR ELSE WE SHOULD JUST CLOSE THIS PAGE AND ALLOW NOBODY TO EDIT IT BECAUSE IT MUST BE FACT!!! AFTER ALL SOMEONE WHO DOES NOT EVEN KNOW HOW TO PLAY CHESS THINKS A DUSTY PINSKI LINE REFUTES THE ENTIRE OPENING AND IT DOES NOT EVEN ENGAGE IN THE SACRIFICE. IT JUST GIVES THE PIECE BACK LIKE A COWARD AND GETS THE WORLDS MOST BORING POSITIONS THAT ARE ALL 0.00 ACCORDING TO HOUDINI.

before they entered the Chefapeak ; or, if practicable, to attack
them whilft at anchor there. On the i6th, the Iris frigate, at fix

larboard tack. The headmoft fhips of the enemy's fquadron,
at twenty minutes after nine, tacked ; as did the reft in fucceflion,

thirty-five minutes after nine, the weather being very fqually,
the Vice- Admiral made the fignal for his fquadron to form a

  Charles Karel Bouley 

14:58, 21 September 2009 Kelly A. Siebecke (talk | contribs) (10,340 bytes) (the facts were there and JoyDiamond insists on replacing them, removing them, or exaggerating them - edit reverted) 
This just an example of the misrepresentation of the type of continued harassment I have been receiving from Kelly Siebecke.
I replaced parts of articles that were erroneous, removed undue repetition, I exaggerated nothing.
I received a warning this morning that I had been previously warned about removing anything from Kelly's talk page. This is simply untrue. Her only warning was not to TALK (what are talk pages for ?)
A little history: I am a senior citizen who is an acquaintance of Karel Bouley. My first edits were to change things I considered unkind and then all heck ensued as I was told I was not using an objective point of view. My mistake. After discussion with  Feral Druid and another editor, I apologized for my error and assured them  I could be objective and neutral. They accepted that.I am not a wide-eyed fan or close friend. We have a very intermittent working relationship. However, I am privy to the truth of his schedule, personal facts, his history and the details of the death of his partner, whom I also knew. I also participate in his chat room. 
In the chat room, I was warned that there was a room who ostensibly had a grudge against Karel and that may be in an issue. I didn't really take it seriously. As I mentioned I am an older woman with much experience in dealing with difficult people. So, I was not expecting any problems. FYI, I have a Master's degree in Medical Sociology, a Doctorate in divinity. In my B.A. studies I minored in Communication and problem resolution. 
In my observation of Karel's article, I began to notice subtle and not so subtle changes in his article that were making it increasingly negative, positive aspects were deleted even though properly referenced. I made what I considered objective and neutral edits. My edits were reversed and replaced with even more negativity. AS I fumbled my way thru Wiki I discovered the history page and the person of Kelly Siebeck. I checked with the person who had warned me and found it was indeed Kelly. He described it as a vendetta after she had been banned from chat. She denies this is not the issue and angrily claims she is not angry! Please read her  page and decide for yourself about this woman. The problem has escalated recently into personal attacks, removing positive facts and their references. She will tell you I am not good at references. She is right. Feral Druid has been very kind in helping me with those. I still have a lot to learn. BUT I will correct information that is an outright lie and/or demeaning to Karel. I have deleted several times her claim that one of his radio shows was once a week. It is a daily show and was properly reference until she deleted it. SO  now I am reported for excessive deleting of outright misrepresentation and lies!
I do not want to argue with this woman claims her knowledge is superior to mine. That is just ludicrous. I have 14 years of education and 40 years of experience of which she had no knowledge when she claimed she was just WAY more informed than I was. I would just like her to cease and desist and preferably be blocked from Karel's page. Go back to the original article and compare if you can. I will have NO reason to edit when Karel's page is cleaned up and stays that way. Karel has requested that it be locked. There is no reason to repeat he was fired at the beginning of too many sentences. She does that repeatedly. Yes, he was fired, Twice. No reason to repeat it over and over. Much of his colorful history and various talents have been deleted. It is sad. I tried writing her a nice ministerial letter to no avail. I am tired. I edit ONE article and am repeatedly attacked dismissed and insulted.  She is petty and without relent. AS the """"great"""" philosopher Rodney King said """"why can't everybody just be nice? ;-) I work with Karel. I know the good the bad and the ugly, and will record such as long it is truthful and factual.
I am sorry this dear woman a has a problem with Karel and myself. What started out as a relatively decent article has turned mean spirited and wildly inaccurate. Karel is controversial enough with someone adding to it. Please help. I am a nice lady with a little temper. My grandchildren think I am awesome. I am funny, I have something to contribute. I was Valedictorian at age 42. Work with me please. I thought if I could work with Karel I could work with anyone. I was wrong.

He was born in Khwarizm, in the Khorasan province. At the time of his birth, it was part of the Arab Islamic Caliphate, now it's part of the Uzbegistan nation-state. Alas, Persians burnt us saying that it's in fact Persian, so let's take it as Persian. Now, according to sources cited by Heja Helwada, Khorasan in general had a huge Arab population. In accordance to that, defining him as Persian simply because he was born in Khorasan, is not only disputed at best, it also constitutes OR(original research) which is against Wiki's policy, see: WP:NOR

A troll showed up lately and claimed that Arabs are fighting a losing battle, I'm not sure we're in a battle-field here, but I got the gist: he thinks we have no sources...poor little guy!

"General review of article ==

The Wikipedia article on François Mitterrand, who served as president of France from 1981 to 1995, does not take a neutral stance on the man and his career. The language, organization and fact choices of the article make clear the author’s negative opinion of Mitterrand. Even though the sources of information for the article are weak, the author attempts to convey the disreputable nature of his career by citing various scandals and controversies. Because the author is biased, it is difficult to obtain an accurate picture of Mitterrand from reading this article.

By the end of the third paragraph, with the comment about Mitterrand denying having received the Francisque, the author is already trying to establish Mitterrand’s sketchy past. He or she is trying to persuade the reader that Mitterrand was a less than honorable man who will be remembered more for scandals than for what he accomplished during his presidency. The author mentions Charles de Gaulle’s supposed dislike of Mitterrand, his covering up of illegal acts during the repression of the independence movement, and a possible attempt to stage his own assassination. Other scandals include false health reports, adultery, and an anti-terror cell he set up that may have “obtained wiretaps on journalists, politicians and other personalities who may have been an impediment for Mitterrand’s personal affairs.” Scandals are mentioned throughout the article and the author ends with a section devoted to them, so the reader is left with little recollection of Mitterrand’s accomplishments but a strong memory of the controversy that surrounded the president’s career. 

Though the author uses phrases like “he was said to,” one senses that the author is assuming that the alleged stories are fact, and that he has drawn conclusions about Mitterrand based on those stories. Also, the author mentions Mitterrand in relation to other leaders and sometimes it appears that Mitterrand does not measure up. The author seems to favor Charles de Gaulle, noting that Mitterrand was “one of the few to object to the nomination of Charles de Gaulle as head of the government and de Gaulle’s plan for a French Fifth Republic.” The author also uses a phrase usually applied to de Gaulle’s decline to Mitterrand’s decline (“crossing of the desert”). When discussing Mitterrand’s annual laying of a wreath on Philippe Pétain’s grave, the author makes sure to remark that “the annual tributes…marked a departure from those of his predecessors.”

The article is convincing in its portrayal of Mitterrand as a controversial figure whose career was characterized by some major accomplishments but also a great deal of scandal. The article also convinces the reader that much about Mitterrand is not known for sure; there is a fair amount of speculation surrounding all of it. It appears that the author tries to downplay Mitterrand’s accomplishments and convince the reader that his legacy is not a good one. This is not convincing however, because Mitterrand served longer as president than any other man; he must have been more popular than the author makes him out to be.

The sources for this article appear inadequate. Unlike some Wikipedia articles, this article does not have a bibliography or list of references so it is unclear where the author is getting his information. He says that one piece of information comes from author Jean Montaldo but does not list the book. There are three numbered links within the article: two links to articles from the French newspaper Le Monde, and one link to an article on netscape.qc.ca. While these are acceptable sources, they cannot compare to primary sources or articles from historical journals. The lack of adequate sources makes some of the author’s claims questionable.

The quality of writing of the article is not outstanding. There is a typo in the second paragraph: “an mid-level functionary.” At times it is a bit choppy and the paragraphs do not always flow into each other perfectly. The author also devotes an entire section to the famous last meal, and only briefly mentions Mitterrand’s personal life at the end of the presidency section. The article ends with a paragraph that states Mitterrand personally authorized what New Zealand called their first terror attack, which is an interesting choice for a conclusion that leaves the reader associating Mitterrand with terror and bombing. The inclusion of the discovery of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus is puzzling and seems unnecessary, as do the two paragraphs about Bérégovoy and Pelat. It appears that some pieces of information were included simply to paint a more negative portrait of Mitterrand. 

I would have liked to know more about Mitterrand’s “great projects,” because the projects that are listed seem to be very significant structures in France. Some additional information about his personal life woul",[],0

 You asked: Do I want Esperanza back? 

I'm sorry, I don't really know whether or not I do anymore. There is a pervasive fad in taking a """"bootcamp"""" attitude to what wikipedia contributors can do, and it seems toward the end that Esperanza tried to conform to this belief rather than defy it, as evident in the paradigm shift during Esperanza's overhaul as well as the community's deletion of the coffee lounge and most games on wikipedia.

 Talk:Josephus

So you get an even more direct question in return: Why make it obvious that you know a lot about Wikipedia, without telling us that you find it useful when you are a very direct person otherwise? For one, you are calling them out on the most inconvenient of all questions for them. If you don't mind, I'm going to take this straight to the source: WPO peeps, what the dealio? I've asked people on WP to put up or shut up. I've asked the WMF to walk their talk. In fact, I've staked my rep several times now, and I'm not done yet. Now I'm asking you, why don't you stop whining for once and show people you can actually do better? On-wiki or off-, Obi-wan certainly isn't the first to question your self-righteous assertions on how to build an online encyclopedia better than Wikipedia. I, for one, have been wondering for a while now. So, let's see what you can do besides making snarky, personal comments. Here's a pot, and here's a kettle. Need I mention what color they are?
Onwards with Obi-wan's points. I don't believe in nasty people. Deciding anyone is bad, nasty, etc. has only one purpose; one can feel better about being bad, nasty, etc. to people they've so judged. I don't think this is particularly productive. In fact, IMO it is unbelievably destructive once someone decides- or, more often, others have convinced them- that they themselves are bad people. We could talk about this more in another thread, but we've got to get back on topic here, so. . . You know that the Wikipediocrats are smart. You have spent more time there than you're willing to admit directly. I immediately wonder if it's just in reading or in writing, too. ) They are indeed among the smartest in the WP community reasoning-wise that I've met so far. But emotionally. . . less than average. How do you think many of these smart m'er f'ers ended up getting indef blocked or banned? A lot of them fell from grace, not because they weren't an asset to the community, but because they didn't seem to know when- or they were completely unwilling- to stop fighting for what they saw as justice. That's one part of the answer; many of them are banned or blocked- whether rightly so or not- from editing on Wikipedia. Also, it's normal for someone who has been banished to tell themselves they wish harm on their homeland, while still keeping a great emotional investment in it. You'll hear the same people spout their disdain for Wikipedia almost in the same breath as suggestion to improve it. Frankly, we could speculate about these people's motives and methods til the sun goes down. Let's be more practical about what is best for Wikipedia here. What we, as a Wikipedia community, can't do is ignore them away. And, even if we could, we're doing a piss-poor job of it, because I almost always hear about what's been said on Wikipediocracy from a Wikipedian before I go to the actual site. Ultimately, I go back to my old standard: I don't give a shit where these people come from or what their motives are; all's I know is that they are saying something interesting, and I appreciate the fact that I don't have to gloss over a bunch of posts that are trying to get them to shut up as I read it.

 Is Occupy Oakland ongoing or defunct?  

I concur with 's reversions today on the Occupy movement and Occupy Oakland articles, where other users (possibly vandals) attempted to cast Occupy in the past tense. It's premature to portray the overall movement as deceased. However, solely with respect to Occupy Oakland, this is an issue worth discussing.

Note that the Infobox at Occupy Oakland differs from those on Wikipedia's pages for Occupy movement and Occupy Wall Street, respectively. Occupy Oakland is the only one where the word """"ongoing"""" appears—once on the Date line and again on a separate Status line.

I submit that Occupy Oakland's lack of activity over the past several months suggests that it may now be time to reconsider Wikipedia's use of """"ongoing"""" applied exclusively to Occupy Oakland.

There is currently a small amount of autonomous organizing around two upcoming anniversaries: the group's October 10 birthday and the October 25 riot where Scott Olsen was shot in the head. However, none of this stems from Occupy Oakland collectively or any of its designated committees. It's being conducted strictly by self-appointed individuals. Even allowing that anniversary activities are likely to take place, the question looms: do these constitute evidence of an """"ongoing"""" group or are they merely nostalgic gestures by a few diehard remnants?

I hope  and other experienced Wikipedia editors will clarify this for me. Please, at what point do we stop referring to Occupy Oakland as ongoing?   """,[],0

"Improvements
I have completed the B class checklist and believe that this article is a Start class article as it fails to meet B class criteria 1 and 2. I believe that the article could be improved by addressing the following issues:

 Referencing: the addition of inline citations would help improve the verifiability of the information in the article. For a successful B class review the article requires at least one in line citation per paragraph or block of information (more if multiple sources were used);
 Coverage: there are large sections in complete which need to be finished before it can be assessed properly. Additionally, the article does not seem to indicate when the Division was disbanded, or what its fate was after WWI. Was it disbanded, if so was it ever re-raised?

Just a few ideas. If you would like more comprehensive comments regarding the article you might like to submit it for peer review by going to WP:MHPR, but I suggest waiting until the article has been completed before doing this.

IntroductionSecond Paragraph
The source coming from the peak is not appropriate as it does not support what you have written.  The article makes legal distinction between CFS BC and CFS national.  It doesn't support a broad assertion that as you say """"The CFS generally referred to legally consists of 3 separate organizations, the national CFS, a provincial chapter and CFS-Services which are often collectively referred to as CFS""""

Also: """"The organizations generally brand themselves as CFS and do not make the distinction between the branches.""""
Your source does not support that statement. Also """"brand"""" is a corporate term and not NPOV language.

Also: """"In addition, it is impossible to belong to one division and not another making the CFS de-facto one organization"""" Is not supported by the one source you provided.

See the reliable sources policy: """"Sources should directly support the information as it is presented in an article and should be appropriate to the claims made;"""" - WP:RELY

I'll clear the air here before I continue upon the current situation. 

I feel like I am being painted as the bad guy here, and that my editing and/or the editing of others is considered to be an American POV. I quote 

 Yet it was apparently Americans who started this article.

For the record. Yes I started this article. No I am not American. Such accusations that I am American and therefore my stance at maintaining the American ratings is of a POV nature are not only unfounded but unfair.

Secondly in regards to the link and image. This is no place to discuss such an issue here to begin with, and bringing it up in this situation is simply adding fuel to the fire. Furthermore it is simply a slap in the face given that just hours prior to your post I had re-opened dialogue asking for help choosing 1 of 4 new images for the infobox located here: Talk:Rookie Blue#New_Image. Since you have brought this up I have no choice but to defend myself and the editors involved about violations of NPOV. The items in question were added in this edit:  at 23:08, 17 May 2010. At the time of the edit the only available material was from the ABC. I refer you to the following two links. The first will show that the ABC Rookie Blue website was indexed on the 28 Apr 2010. The second link will show that the GlobalTV Rookie Blue website was indexed on the 12 Jun 2010. Hell I will even used google.ca:

ABC:
http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&lr;=&tbs;=qdr%3Ay&q;=%22http%3A%2F%2Fabc.go.com%2Fshows%2Frookie-blue%22&aq;=f&aqi;=&aql;=&oq;=&gs;_rfai=

Global:
http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&lr;=&tbs;=qdr%3Ay&q;=%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.globaltv.com%2Frookieblue%2Findex.html%22&aq;=f&aqi;=&aql;=&oq;=&gs;_rfai=

As you can see Logical_Fuzz did no wrong as the material from Global was not available to him/her till nearly a month later. As far as I know Logical_Fuzz is in the North American region. Specifically what nationality I am unsure of, but his/her edits were made in good faith and not in an American POV. Any further allegations that state me or other editors that have contributed to this article or the main article have violated NPOV, without proper proof backing those allegations; will not be met with too kindly.

Third. I was the one who added that is was a Canadian police drama (evidence here: ) as I accept it is a mainly a Canadian production. If I wanted to I could easily say it was a Canadian-American production. This should further dispel any such allegations that I am in violation of NPOV.

Now on with what I am to say. As I said I accept that this is mainly a Canadian Production. The page says Canadian but it also says the following:

 The series is a joint venture between Canwest Broadcasting and ABC, and produced by E1 Entertainment.

Given that Canwest also put out a joint announcement with the ABC () renewing Rookie Blue for a second season, I think it is fair to say a joint venture doesn't mean that anything American immediately takes a back seat. In regards to the """"Do not add foreign broadcasters here"""" comment. I am confused. Are you suggesting we remove the ABC as the original channel? Or have you just read it wrong and trying to argue that the picture and website don't below because it says """"Do not add foreign broadcasters here""""?

Read the first sentence of this whole exchange.

The alternative would appear to be a long explanation of the Napoleonic edict.

  
Thank you, that sounds good, although I would prefer a link to an explanatory article or some footnote, but maybe that's just me. One more thing: the italics around his father's name and the bolding of Offenbach ought to be dropped.    

 Play titles 
Confusingly, in 'other stage works', three of the play titles with a Wikipedia link are no longer spelled the same (case) as given in the articles about the plays...   
Can you clarify? There are no red links in that section. zach 
There aren't any red links because the three plays in question are piped links to their English titles. Cg2p0B0u8m's observation that the French titles in these articles uses different capitalisation is correct. We know that the most widely used style of French title capitalisation, which is a bit idosyncratic and not cosnsistently applied in French writing, is not used in the opera or classical music projects on Wikipedia where a strict but easily understood system is used. Other projects are not so strict; that's why those articles on the plays use a different spelling.    
Ah. Missed that. Shouldn't we be using the English titles? After all The Tales of Hoffmann appears just below. zach 
Wouldn't that make for an awkward list as we don't have English titles for all these plays?    
Perhaps, but then what is the least bad solution? My primary editing instinct tells me that consistency should come first — at least within the article. zach 
But at the cost of consistency within the paragraph. — (shrug) Whatever, no biggie. The list itself is a useful improvement to the article, in whichever language the titles are listed.    

Yes, it's not a major thing. From Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style_(France_%26_French-related)#Works_of_art it seemed that only classical music and opera had opted out of l’Académie française / into 'Grove'; no problem.    
Also visual arts, but as we have often remarked, this is a classic 'no-win' situation. zach """,[],0

So if someone would be to travel through time, their actions would have no effect?

But time travel itself affects the past  you're taking something from the present and putting it in a different point in time, thus, for the context of the earlier point in time you travel to, introducing matter/energy/whatever that didn't exist there before, thus (as per chaos theory) possibly screwing up everything. Any successful travel through time would have an effect, otherwise it wouldn't be time travel.

With that in mind  does the principle boil down to """"time travel is only possible if it has no effect, thus time travel (the possibility of which necessitates having an effect) is not possible""""?

The matter and energy of which the time traveller (and his clothing, etc) consists would (if the universe is a closed system) have been in use by something else at an earlier point in time and thus a re-allocation of matter and energy already existent at that earlier point in time to recreate the time traveller doesn't seem to be a viable alternative either. But if the time traveller can neither be composed of matter and energy that didn't exist, nor of that which already existed but was """"in use"""" already, what does he consist of?

Even if the universe is not a temporally closed system (i.e. matter/energy can vanish and re-appear at future points in time), for something to vanish in the present and re-appear in the past, it would have to vanish before its original appearance unless it can't exist twice at the same point in time (i.e. if atom A was sent back in time from a point Z to a point X, it would vanish at point Z (now) and appear at point X (back then) as A', but have to vanish again as time advances closer to the point Y (somewhere before point Z) where it was originally introduced as A, otherwise A and A' (which should be identical) would exist at the same point in time, which would definitely be an alteration of past events and thus incompatible with the principle.

I'm assuming the principle isn't based on the simplification of the idea that the only thing that """"matters"""" is the action/inaction of humans (as in the interpretation of Schroedinger's experiment that the cat is in an unknown state where it is both alive and dead until the human interacts with it  which implies the human's perception determines the state of reality). If that is true, then the example from Twilight Zone where someone goes back in history to start the fire he travelled back in time to prevent is clearly contradictory as it introduces a paradox (a time travel having to have occurred in order for the time travel to occur) unless it actually changed the events (i.e. originally the fire would have been caused by something else), which would still be inconsistent with the principle which doesn't allow for any changes of the past.

I'm aware this post is getting a bit rant-y, but I'm seriously at a loss here. How does time travel NOT change the past, regardless of whether it has any consequences in the grand scheme of things or not? The very concept of travel backwards through time is that one appears at an earlier point of time, thus changing the past.

The only possibility I can think of for time travel not to change the past is a paradox in which the time travel happens because it has already occurred (i.e. the future representation (person A') of someone (person A) appears in the present and at some future point in time the same events cause person A to travel back in time that """"already"""" caused person A' to go back in time, i.e. both of their time lines are identical), but in which there is no """"other"""" time line in which the time traveller didn't already appear before travelling back in time (i.e. there is no time line in which person A travels back in time without person A' having travelled in time already, i.e. where person A doesn't eventually become person A', the time traveller).

All of this is obviously rendered null and void if the laws of physics are inconsistent and random stuff does appear out of thin air for no reason. —  (talk · contribs) """,[],0
"Article on Sexual Orientation 

Thanks for the information you sent on signing edits, however, I had problems using it.  Unfortunately, I did not sign my most recent changes because I could not find the place to add my signature.

I have added three links I believe enrich the discussion on sexual orientation.  All links regarding prostaglandins and sexual behavior/development are relevant to the discussion of whether sexual orientation is determined from birth.  Moreover, the paper by Amateau and McCarthy the one by Sanders are of interest for raising the issue of epitestosterone's influence on brain gender and sex behavior.  

Recently, epitestosterone and the T/E ratio have received a great deal of attention in the press, and given that the upswing of endocrine research on homosexuals started with a paper that found significantly lowered excretion of testosterone and epitestosterone in homosexual men, the GLBT community should be aware of this research (see Endocrine Function in Male and Female Homosexuals, Loraine et al. 1970; and Sex Hormones and Male Homosexuality, Meyer-Bahlburg 1977).",[],0

Or, does confidentiality prevent him from forwarding that mail to another admin to get a second opinion?

You are writing too much and not directly responding to text written by others. In my comment that you mention above, I point out that you had posted 8 times in 24 hours on the talk page of an article concerned with the practice of using one space or two spaces between sentences. Furthermore, those posts came after a lot of other talk page activity; that much discussion is not warranted.
May I make a suggestion? Regular editors here see far too much irrelevant commentary, and their brains go into automatic after reading a couple of off-topic sentences. You are inadvertently obfuscating your point because you preface it with too much extraneous material. For a practical illustration of what I mean, I suggest that you should either comment here about my style (and if you like, request opinions at WP:WQA), or comment at Talk:Sentence spacing on a single point that relates to improving the article. It would be best to not mention jargon like """"BRD"""" because it only obfuscates your point.

 Accusations you made against Harvey Bialy 

 I see no external (not wiki) source for you grave accusation against Harvey Bialy. Please provide us with that external source. You MUST do it. Thank you.

One can find any number of uncouth Bialy quotes here, including the one which I mentioned. However, my source was the dissident AIDSWiki, which proudly publicized Bialy's comments here. By the way, it was not so much a """"grave accusation"""" as a direct quote from Bialy which he himself has gone out of his way to publicize. An accusation is unnecessary; his words speak for themselves.  

The accusation was to say that Bialy said that, but seems that he said it. We do not know what was said in the previous dialogue with the other guy, though. 

Wikipedia is a tertiary source, and anyone can write anything. That´s the reason I asked you for an external source. Anyway, thank you for the references.

Sine, cosine, tangent, cotangent, secant, cosecant are:  O/H,  A/H,  Oh/Ah,  Ah/Oh,  H/A,  H/O.

Unlike the soa-cah-toa nemonic it gives all six common functions.  But I like to teach only the 1st three, OH, AH, Oh-Ah (simple enough), or even only the first two, OH AH  and have them (students) memorize only Sin, Cos, and Tan   then have them learn and understand that tan= sin/cos and the last three are inverses of the 1st three.

It might sound a bit like a tongue twister at first, but it only took a my high school trig class about 15 minutes to learn it and a good part of that time was laughter  and it is silly enough to be memorable. I still use it after 45+ years and some of my today's students have picked it up too as the one they prefer (over soh cah toa).",[],0

 Greetings from the Opera Project again 

Hi, Satyr.  You'll remember that you and your bot did some excellent work for us (on the Wagner sub-project) a few months ago.  How are you fixed at present?  We'd like to dip a bigger toe in the assessment process by automatically giving a """"Start"""" rating to those articles that are tagged with the Opera Project banner and are not already classified as Stub.

Exceptions:  articles which have been promoted to Good Article, Featured Article or Featured List should show those ratings on the banner.  Also, it would be good if any articles which currently show Stub on the banner but have been manually de-stubbed without the banner having been altered could be rated Start.

We'd like the facility to comment when we start doing the assessments.  For the Wagner project, you organised it so that the banner carries a dormant link:  if a comments page is present, there's a link, but if not, not.  The link will nevertheless appear (and work) if a comments page is subsequently added.

I can give some examples of the various possibilities outlined above if that would help, and you might like to review our correspondence about the Wagner project to refresh your memory of what you did then (also to refresh your memory of how useless we were then at specifying what exactly we wanted, maybe!).

 Richard III  

Now is the winter of our discontent 
Made glorious summer by this sun of York;
And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house 
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths; 
Our bruised arms hung up for monuments; 
Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings, 
Our dreadful marches to delightful measures. 
Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;
And now, instead of mounting barded steeds 
To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,
He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,
Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;
I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty 
To strut before a wanton ambling nymph; 
I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion, 
Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,
Deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time
Into this breathing world, scarce half made up, 
And that so lamely and unfashionable
That dogs bark at me as I halt by them;
Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,
Have no delight to pass away the time,
Unless to spy my shadow in the sun
And descant on mine own deformity:
And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover, 
To entertain these fair well-spoken days,
I am determined to prove a villain...

Many people, even famous ones, say many things, much of it nonsense. That does not mean their nonsense should be given credibility in the Wikipedia. 

Comparing a movement to Lysenkoism implies that it contradicts the scientific consensus but has state or politically connected support. The enviromentalism that Crichton criticises indeed does have the support of most states and politicians, but it is also the scientific consensus. If anything Crichton is the one who can be compared to Lysenko. His anti-environmental views contradict the scientific consensus and in this he has the support of many top politicians in the US, possibly even the current President. Frankly though, making analogies with Lysenkoism  should be done sparingly. Lysenkoism was a dreadful period for many people living in the former USSR. Only the worst excesses of state-supported pseudo-science should be compared to it. (Nathan Geffen)

Article issues
This article has some issues that need to be addressed. The first is that of notability. As it is now, the article fails to establish any notability. It is merely a plot summary and, as was explained numerous times at Talk:List of NCIS episodes, Wikipedia is not for plot summaries. It is likely that each individual episode of a television series will not be notable on its own. As per WP:PLOT, """"a concise plot summary is appropriate as part of the larger coverage of a fictional work"""", but on its own the plot does not establish notability. As it says in the {{notability}} tag that kepps getting removed, notability needs to be established by adding reliable, secondary sources. At the moment, there are none. More on this later.

The plot summary in this article is not concise by any means. It needs to be pruned and appropriate information concerning """"the reception, impact, and significance"""" of the episode must be added.

A third issue is that of references. I've already mentioned that reliable, secondary sources do not exist in the article. Of the two references that do exist in the article, one is a primary source. The other (cbsncis.wetpaint.com) is a fan wiki that anyone can edit and so it is not a reliable source. Open wikis such as cbsncis.wetpaint.com are questionable, self-published sources and are generally not acceptable. The expansion of this article will require much better sources.   """,[],0

 My old pal Sam! 

http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=2587275

 My old pal Sam!

Last night I decided to google the name of the most despised kid in my hometown. I went to school with him for 9 years and have a whole list of horror stories. His name is legendary in the childhood memories of my friends and I. Sam.

Sam was the kid who ate cat food at lunch. Sam was the kid who always smelled like shit (moreso on the occasions he actually shit himself). Sam has a collection of awesome dragon shirts. Sam was a genius, too. It always puzzled me what he was doing barely passing his classes in elementary and middle school. Perhaps his superior mind just wandered. Sam would often tell us about and draw pictures of his English girlfriend, who flew to america every weekend to fuck him. On special occasions Sam would share with us selections of the many books he had written. Yeah Sam had it made.

So I was curious of the life Sam was leading now, a year after he has graduated High School. Is he returning for his sophomore year at Oxford? Is he happily married to his stick figure with huge tits?

well, I've kept him in the dark long enough, so say hello to Sam!

    Now, before you walk off saying how stupid this is, let me explain something to you. I do not have a life of any kind. I occasionally have a girlfriendusually a girl who thinks """"This nice, sweet guy ain't got the best body, but I'm sure he'll put me before anything else."""" and how wrong they were! More often than not I find myself alone in my room, doing nothing but hanging out with my computer.

Sam is also looking for love!

 From user Jshapely 

Dear reviewer,

thank you very much for your suggestions on the article I wrote on Alessandro Liberati. To address your concerns about his notability:

he is especially known as one of the founders of the Cochrane Collaboration, an international network of over 28,000 volunteers in more than 100 countries formed to organize research information about health care interventions in a systematic way, to aid well informed health care decisions (see also the description available in Wikipedia about the Collaboration). To date, more than 5000 “systematic reviews” on specific topics have been published in the Cochrane Library. Due to its relevance, widely acknowledged by clinicians, health care researchers and policymakers, the Cochrane Collaboration has a seat on the World Health Assembly to provide inputs on resolutions of the World Health Organization. The founder role of Liberati has been acknowledged by Sir Iain Chalmers Chalmers I. Alessandro Liberati: a personal appreciation. Epidemiologia & Prevenzione 2012;36:3. Available at http://www.epiprev.it/attualit%C3%A0/alessandro-liberati-un-ricordo-personale, who is himself acknowledged as one of the founders of the Collaboration in 1993 (see his profile in Wikipedia). The Italian Cochrane Centre was one of the first to be established (in 1994). Other people have their profile on Wikipedia mainly because of their role in the Collaboration (aside from Iain Chalmers, see also Dave Sackett and Chris Silagy). The relevant role of Liberati in the Collaboration can be also better understood by reading the countless acknowledgements in the farewell page http://www.cochrane.org/features/farewell-professor-alessandro-liberati  and in the memory book http://www.cochrane.org/alessandro-memory-book posted on the Cochrane website.
As for his published work (one of the relevant features indicated in the Wikipedia notability guidelines for academics) he is author of more than 200 papers published in peer reviewed and indexed journals, as it can be easily verified in Pubmed or in Google Scholar; some of these papers represent highly cited academic work, especially on how to report results of meta analyses and systematic reviews. 
As for other characteristics which can be worth highlighting (also according to the Wikipedia guidelines), he was on editorial boards of prestigious and selective academic journals, such as the Annals of Internal Medicine (house organ of the American College of Physicians) and the British Medical Journal (of the British Medical Association).
Last but not the least, several obituary articles followed his death on specialized medical journals; among these, I would like to highlight the one on The Lancet Watts G. Alessandro Liberati. Lancet 2012;379:214 (which is, according to the Journal Citation Index, the second general medical journal for number of citations) and the one on the British Medical Journal Magrini N, Smith R. Alessandro Liberati. Campaigned for high quality evidence relevant to patients. BMJ 2012;344:e1101
All these things I tried to make explicit in my article, supporting them with several citations for verifiability (a few of which also available online). I understand your point that my article may appear as a tribute to a recently dead person. As for neutral point of view, I didn’t find testimonies contrary to the good reputation I reported for Liberati. To limit the “tribute feeling” that the article may transmit, I cut the last two paragraphs (on his work in Italy and on his networking role).

Hoping that this may help support the new submission, I send you my best regards  — Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)

Ok, I added a paragraph about Native Americans and the national park.

 Comment on Seregain 

Actually, I was never almost blocked for my behavior. If you'll read the past AN/I incident, a user (Coldplay Expert) proposed a malformed """"topic ban"""" after the issue had already been resolved (which Jclemens corrected him on). He apologized afterwards

Since Jclemens ended the dispute, Seregain's edits were never reviewed, but I'll be happy to bring them back up again. As for """"wikistalking"""", Seregain linked to an offsite forum profile which he believed to be me and complained on Wikipedia for something said offline (personally I think he deserves an immediate ban for trying to """"out"""" me on other sites, but I'll let the admins handle it).

 as daft as it sounds yes, if it cant be verified it gets removed plain and simple i suggest you reread these core wikipedia policies wp:truth wp:verifable wp:rs wp:nor and wp:nor i hav enot intentions in edit warring with you over it but be warned since it isnt sourced anyone can remove it and report you for vandelism. (talk - contrib) 

 (As it says on my talk page, I prefer to have discussions all in the same place. I am watching this page, so please reply here. To this end I have taken the liberty of moving your previous reply here.)

 So if I add a statement that there are no vacuum tubes in SSDs either, you'll insist on a source for that too? 

 Seriously, you are mistaken on a few points. I think you need to read WP:VERIFY yourself: 

  All material in Wikipedia mainspace, including everything in articles, lists and captions, must be verifiable. All quotations and any material whose verifiability has been challenged or is likely to be challenged, must include an inline citation that directly supports the material. Any material that needs a source but does not have one may be removed. (emphasis added - jeh) 

 Note the distinction. You wrote """"if it can't be verified it gets removed"""". But, first, the claim that SSDs contain no disks obviously can be verified. Not only is it part of the definition of the term, the very first reference in that very article confirms this claim in its description of these devices. So, no, we don't need to cite a source for this particular instance of the claim. 

 And second, except for BLP issues, WP:V only states that unsourced material that needs a source may be removed. This material didn't need a source, and even if it did, it isn't required to remove it right away. Even for claims that really should have a citation to a WP:RS, the polite and widely accepted thing to do is to add a """"citation needed"""" template. See template:cn. This is a much less abrasive thing to do to someone's edit rather than simply reverting it. 

 I suppose you could say """"well, since I removed it, its verifiability has been challenged so now it does require a source."""" Yeah, fine. So I go to the work of adding a reference name to one of the refs that's already there, and then cite that same ref from my new text as well. No, it's not much work, but consider: Does it really improve the article to add a reference footnote number to a statement that is as obviously true as this one? Is adding that little footnote number really the best use of my time here? Was it the best use of yours? And will this little challenge you raised over a completely trivial edit and obvious claim make me feel more or less eager to contribute to WP in the future? 

 Also: In my edit I merely noted that despite the term """"solid state disk"""" there are no actual """"disks"""" inside these devices. In your edit comment you said """"since they refer to it is a disk we must to [sic]"""". Well, that is true, but my edit did not remove any reference to the terms """"solid state disk"""" or """"electronic disk"""" from the article, nor even claim that such were wrong. So your edit comment was off point and provided no valid justification for your action. 

 Finally, I must point out that you are wrong about vandalism. The fact is that edits made in good faith are not generally considered vandalism. After reading WP:VERIFY you should probably look at WP:VANDALISM:

Even if misguided, willfully against consensus, or disruptive, any good-faith effort to improve the encyclopedia is not vandalism. Edit warring over content is not vandalism. Careful consideration may be required to differentiate between edits that are beneficial, detrimental but well-intentioned, and vandalizing. Mislabelling good-faith edits as vandalism can be considered harmful. (emphasis added - jeh)

 You should probably also read WP:AGF to see what """"good faith"""" means and what you are supposed to do about assuming it.  

 In sum: Please be careful about undo'ing others' edits until you are more familiar with the actual prescriptions of things like WP:VERIFY. Consider using the CN template rather than reverting unsourced material. Please think carefully before tossing around words like """"vandalism"""". 

 And you should never have """"intentions of edit-warring"""", so the statement that you don't have any here is troubling. Why would you need to state such a thing, if not for the possibility that you might have s",[],0

Sorry to take so long in replying, I've only had a small amount of WP time the last few days.  I see the point you are making, on the other hand it seems useful to say something about General Haftar's character given such a reputable source says something about it after consulting 20-odd people - which given FT's reputation you would think is a balanced representation of his contacts, but they do not say who they were. I agree the FT quote """"wasn’t well informed in politics"""" is very surprising given his position. I'm happy with you removing this, and will ponder if there is a better way to give the info.  FT registration is no-cost for a few articles a month, but here is a wider quote of what they said:

Even supporters acknowledge his political ambitions, suspecting he plans to anoint himself leader of the country’s liberals. The armed forces he now purports to lead are successors to the Gaddafi-era military he repeatedly turned against; the Islamist militias he is fighting are the ones with which he fought in the 2011 uprising. Many wonder whether he is a committed democrat, as he claims, or just another Arab military officer with dictatorial ambitions, in the mould of Egypt’s Gamal Abdel Nasser, Syria’s Hafez Assad and Gaddafi.You need someone tough like Haftar to step up to the outlaws,” says the commentator Abdel Hamid el-Jadi. “He has experience in the Libyan military and he knows the tribes. If he has political ambitions we’ll deal with that in the second stage.”

But others worry about what they describe as a brittle personality and myopic worldview. Of nearly two- dozen people who have had dealings with him and spoke to the Financial Times, none could identify any of his interests outside war. In meetings with exiled opposition groups in the US and Africa, before he returned to serve as the rebel army’s chief of staff in the 2011 uprising, he spoke only of his military expertise. “He wasn’t well informed in politics, relationships between countries or cultures,” said one Gaddafi-era opposition activist.Many Libyans and international experts fear the offensive that Mr Haftar is co-ordinating could further destabilise the country. In televised appearances, he has a habit of conflating the Islamist militias with members of parliament and the government who belong to the Libyan Muslim Brotherhood, and with al-Qaeda.''

 Samoa mo Samoa - Mata Usi Wikipedia 

Samoa (i/səˈmoʊ.ə/; Samoan: Sāmoa, IPA: [ˌsaːˈmoa]), officially the Independent State of Samoa (Samoan: Malo Sa'oloto Tuto'atasi o Sāmoa), formerly known as Western Samoa, is a country encompassing the western part of the Samoan Islands in the South Pacific Ocean. Samoa announced their independence to Aotearoa - New Zealand in 1962. The main island of Samoa is Upolu, and is one of the largest islands in the Polynesian Triangle, next to Savai'i. The capital city, Apia, and Faleolo International Airport are situated on the island of Upolu.

Samoa was admitted to the United Nations on 15 December 1976.[6] The entire island group, inclusive of American Samoa, has been called “Navigators Islands” by late European explorers, who at 3000 years after Polynesia's """"Age of Navigation"""" surged into an era of exploration. Before the 20th century because of the Samoans' seafaring skills, and origins of Polynesian culture,  

History Main article: History of Samoa
Many recent studies into the pre-history of Samoa has been taken up by Asia Pacific Universities, including departments in Aotearoa - New Zealand. In general public education, the Polynesian Expansion is chronologically studied in the range of 3,000 years, leading off at a Lapita site at Mulifanua during the 1970s.[8]

The origins of """"The Samoan Expansions"""" are linked to the Pre-historical waves of Southeast Asian expansions which is a continued study in modern research in various scientific disciplines such as Genetics, Linguistics and Anthropology. Scientific research resides on the results that the Samoans originate from, or of, the ancient lines of Austronesian expansions and predecessors during some of the first waves expansions eastward across Southern Asia and Asia Pacific. The Lapita expansion period from Southeast Asia through Melanesia between 2,500 and 1,500 BCE is an on going Anthropological interest.[9] The Samoan origins are currently being thoroughly assessed due to new scientific evidence and carbon dating findings from 2003 and onwards.

It's theorized that intimate sociocultural and genetic ties were maintained in Pre-historical eras between the Polynesian Lapita colonies. Archaeological record supports Samoan oral History and Genealogy that indicate inter-island exploration, war, colonization, and eras of Monarchal ties between ancient Samoans, Tongans, Fijians, and in Eastern Polynesia orders - Ali'i.

Jacob Roggeveen (1659–1729), a Dutchman, was the first documented to sight the Samoan islands in 1722. This visit was followed by another western explorer Louis-Antoine de Bougainville (1729–1811), who named them the Navigator Islands in 1768. Contact was limited before the 1830s which is when missionaries and traders began seeking relations with Samoan orders.

Religious missions were cautious in Samoa which began in the late 1830's by John Williams, of the London Missionary Society arriving in Sapapali'i from The Cook Islands and Tahiti.[10] According to Barbara A. West, another western author seeking interests of readers, """"The Samoans were also known to engage in “headhunting,” a practice invoked in ancient Samoan warfare, in which a warrior took the head of his slain opponent to give to his leader, thus taking his Mana.""""[11] By that time, the Samoans had gained a reputation of being savage and warlike from a famously published French journal of the times, which insued panic during that time, and a wonder of Samoan invasion. The violent altercations had occurred between a village of Samoa and a French expedition [La Perouse Expedition], who had lost almost the entire crew leaving the expedition adrift, over a French sailor direspecting a Samoan woman.

Later expeditions by the British, German, and American forces, who by the late nineteenth century understood the invaluble oceanic position of Samoan trade, sought it's cooperation in resupply and refueling for coal-fired shipping and whaling.

Historian David Irving states that part of this reason was due to the totally inadequate production levels, with 250 single-engined and 64 twin-engined fighter aircraft produced on avarage per month during early 1941Irving 1974, p. 163., and that as a result, the number of German front line aircraft were declining, and this problem would not be improved until the spring of 1942, with a huge effort to expand production, reaching 1,200 by March/April 1942.Irving 1974, p. 142.

In fact, however, Irving does not make these statements. If you read the book  (which has been linked in free pdf format), here is what he writes on page 163:
On Milch’s desk there were already the most alarming reports not only of the gathering RAF bomber strength but of bomber production in America too. To him, air defence rested primarily on the fighter squadrons, but at present the Air Staff was calling for only  fighter aircraft to be produced a month. Fighter production had averaged  single- and  twin-engined aircraft a month during . Milch and his new planning chief von Gablenz wanted far greater numbers, and with more bombers as well  not only the  He s but  Ju s of the latest type as well.⁴⁰

etc.

Ie. Irving does not state 'totally inadequate production levels' (and even less, mentions bombers), this is the addition of one editor to the Irving book, which has been described as 'Milchs diary' (which is it not, either)",[],0

I am writing to you re Tony Cragg's article on Wikipedia, which I have been trying to improve. As you quite rightly pointed out, (prior to my editing) Wikipedia's coverage of Cragg's life and career is embarrassingly weak and what I have added is not 'necessarily bad.'

I am new to Wikipedia editing and it has been difficult to get to grips with how it works, but I feel like I am getting there. For all my efforts to be deleted would be a real shame. I would like to start up a dialogue so I can continue to improve Cragg's article.

As I understand it, you have identified the section on the Sculpture Park as posing a potential copyright issue, as a copy or modification of the text from Cragg's website. I did indeed use his website as a point of reference (for lack of other sources) but I am surprised you consider what I edited to be a copyright issue. I will happily work on this section further so as to improve it but I ask that you 'unblock' the rest of article and advise the best way to proceed.

I look forward to hearing from you  
Hi! It is quite amazing to me that someone so well known could have such a poor article here, but that can happen; it will be blanked for a week or so now so that anybody who wants to rewrite it can do so. I do understand that it's very hard to get started as an editor here, and certainly I don't want to make it harder for you. However, you may inadvertently have fallen foul of some of our basic rules, including the one about using several accounts (that isn't in itself a problem, but becomes one if the accounts break other rules, such as, unfortunately, our copyright policy). One of the four accounts has declared a connection to the Lisson Gallery, and the IP address obviously belongs to the gallery; it would be helpful to know if the other three editors who appear to be similarly connected, including you, are so connected, or indeed are all the same real-world person. If you have a connection to the gallery you probably have what we call a conflict of interest, and that means that in most cases you shouldn't edit the article, but limit yourself to suggestions on the talk page. I'm prepared to help with the writing in this case. A good first step would be to start assembling some independent reliable sources about the artist. These should be sources of information that do not have an interest in promoting him, so commercial art gallery websites are unlikely to be acceptable, but websites of public institutions, books, well-known newspapers and magazines are all likely to be good. You could perhaps list some of those on the talk page of the article. While it's helpful if I can see them, it's not obligatory. Then we can take it from there.",[],0

 Fred Meyer: Reversion 

I was asked to explain my reversion of your addition to the Fred Meyer article. That addition was composed of four parts. 
First, you claimed Fred G. Meyer to be a member of the Rosicrucian Order etc., providing sources. I won't discuss the validity of the sources here, but that clearly concerns Fred G. Meyer himself, not the stores, unless you can provide a source that states his business was influenced by his philosophical leanings. 
Next, you elaborated on the rosicrucian connection to Hitler. As far as I can see, the main connection to Fred Meyer was that both Nazism and the stores use the colours red, white and black, which is a rather weak link. No source was provided that the store logo may have been influenced by its Founder's rosicrucian connections. Hitler's connection to the rosicrucians was sourced (again I won't discuss the quality of the sources), but was unrelated to the stores. 
Thirdly, you claimed that the layout of racks gives a swastika and that green freight carts are nicknamed """"U-Boats"""", but this, the part most relevant for the stores, was still unsourced. 
Finally, the """"Notes"""" part could have been more fitting for the talk page, but definitely does not belong into the article proper.
Thus, your additions were either unrelated to the stores or unsourced.

I agree you're probably right to remove the lengthy footnote, but my reason for supporting your removal of the reference would be different, namely that as time goes by some information loses its topical interest and becomes more abstruse (which is, I imagine, the reason it was placed in a footnote and not in the body of the text in the first place).  I therefore appreciate your placing the information on the talk page, for you never know, a serious researcher rather than just a casual visitor who takes a general interest in primary legislation may derive genuine satisfaction in finding it there; the very distinction, I hope you will agree, that marks an encyclopaedia (which should be an extensive knowledge resource) apart from a penny guide-book.  A few points however:
You have left some external links (Blair, Kelly) which had relevance to the detailed former footnote but not to the article.
There is a balance between referencing all statements and introducing clutter.  
The bullet-point statements are accurate (and, in point of fact can be verified easily enough by looking at the linked pages).  And as to technology, if you have a way to put a reference on a footnote using the edit pages, then you are a lot cleverer than I am.
Your criticism is a little disparaging.  It may of course be both accurate and justified, but pejorative language such as yours is quite difficult to read with a constructive attitude.  Perhaps it needs charity?  May I suggest that for the sake of the average grump you adopt the style of academia (which I admire but am no part of), which is to achieve a result coming up with an improvement rather than a half-baked detraction?",[],0

lol good luck with that you're not getting that out of me...i mean i'm willing to compromise and discuss things but you are putting half-assed edits..i'm filling them out an expanding and putting sources on them i might add and you or others with your limited mentality revert an article to 1 with very little information ..how are empty spaces better than filled ones? that makes absolutely no sense...i even provide some sources from where i get my stuff from and still complain n harass?...you prob didn't even notice some of the edits there you see in even your edits and others  were done by ME lol, you just built upon it and added your own, i'm not saying you nor others taking credit for others work and research (i hope not that's just unprofessional and messed up) but you got something of a personal motive that you're not admitting to, if i'm doing the edits as best as i can and doing it the same way as you are and tryign to provide sources...what s the problem then? the stuff i get my info from are from credited  1st or 3rd party websites lol..what more do you need? the signatures of the editors of the other websites where i get my info from? come on now haha..why don't you be a little more honest and say what really is your problem with me instead of making escuses for it and when people confront you about it or want to speak their mind you back out...oh yeah that's very mature pal just because i don't believe in the same ideals as you ...i mean how can  an admin of such  """"REPUTATION"""" be so naive..i don't get it..you don't like others to express their disapproval or speak their mind about how to improve an article  i mean this is what U r doing """"4 + X = 5""""..that's ok to you right ..missing information that you won't even bother to look up fully and this isn't a grammar class people make typos all the time big deal deal with it..this isn't a regular article its a talk page. i got my say as much as you do regardless of how long you have being editing here or your position here etc, i have a say as much as you do...if you can't take criticism of your poorly edited works than maybe you shouldn't be editing here in the first place..you have no seniority or control over me whatsoever..no one does as i don't have over you ...all i'm asking is for me do do things right and i'am i give u sources , i flesh out the articles n fill in the blanks ..what more do you want guy?...don't make arrogant excuses about my typos or so called ramblings just because you can't take being told in your face criticism in your work...the point is i COMPLETE the articles..you and others with your mentality don't finish it or bother to do a more thorough look..so don't make excuses for your wrong doings ..so you can't take criticism, you don't like other people's edits that re more complete and informative than yours unless you are the 1 editing them, you make excuses for people speaking their mind when they tell you things in your face that are mostly true but you aren't mature enough to own up to it, you make it personal...so if you or anyone who thinks like you don't think about it or made the effort than its BAD right?

"The problem is not only or perhaps even primarily with companies, but with non profit organizations, and pressure groups of all sorts. The problem is not primarily with skilled PR professionals, but less skilled people assigned to it, or simply amateurs. There's a good deal of COI editing of companies and products done by fans of the products, not by the companies, and some degree of conflict of interest permeates most of Wikipedia. Almost everything I ever worked on is either because I am interested in it, or want to show off my virtuosity. 
And I agree with Dennis that in most cases we might as well deal with COI on the article page directly, as with other edits. King4057, and others, have asked me at times to approve article drafts they have COI with I have refused to do so, because I will not take the responsibility for something I have not written, beyond seeing it is not blatantly objectionable. Let COI editors declare the affiliations, and then their edits will be judged appropriately. The only time that an edit needs approval on a talk p. is when it is dealing with something that is obviously susceptible, such as removing inconvenient facts.   
The true question is the same with this approach as with prohibiting direct COI editing:  how do we deal with COI editing from people who do not declare it. I see only two approaches. One is to have an high index of suspicion for every edit that might be influenced by conflict of interest, in essence abandoning the principle of Assuming Good Faith. The difficulty here is that very few can write material that is truly at a standard of sourcing that is proof against the possibility of bad faithit requires not only that statements be sourced, but being confident that all the sources have been examined and fairly considered and judge in context. Very little in enWP meets that standard. This would require actual research and fact checking at a degree which is beyond our capabilities, and amounting to what is done by the most careful editorial review. This is not work for amateurs.  It is easy to say, that if our standards are sufficiently high COI will not matter, but this  The other approach is to require all editors to be identified. The principle of permitting anonymous editing makes us vulnerable; it is necessary for those working on certain topics, but there it might have to be assured by some confidential mechanism for assigning names. Either approach means a radical change in Wikipedia.    
The only simple approach is the same we have used for other problems: patiently remove the worst of it, and go from there. '''''' ( talk )",[],0
""" Thirdly, I wrote """"most"""", not """"any"""". If few mass killings were recognised as genocide, that changes nothing: every rule has exceptions.

The Soviet leadership, for unclear reason decided to support Ethiopia - and this barbaric regime suddenly became Communist whereas another one became anti-Communist. In actuality, I doubt any serious studies can confirm that that sudden conversion of Mengistu into Communism caused any increase of mass killings (and, similarly, I doubt Somalia without Communists immediately became a democratic and humanistic state: as you see, this state is even more barbaric that Ethiopia).

"A couple of explanations 

Because I am pretty new to this project and was invited by the Wikipedia policy just to step in and make some edits, I would like apologize for failing to communicate with you effectively, and to clarify a couple of things:

1) I have made in the recent days some substantial contributions and modifications to the Silesia article that I felt would be valuable to the internet readers. I din't expect that some of this changes will meet with such a fierce resistance.

2) These contributions were based on my deep knowledge (in my opinion) and serious studies into the history and modern times of Silesia. My intention was to write about facts and not about opinions, and to avoid any nationalistic bias of any kind.

3) I am very seriously touched that people who introduce most of the chaos and natiolistic bias to this article are the first to accuse others of vandalism and extreme nationalism.

 20:45, 26 Oct 2003 (UTC)

 My suggestion: let's write what Silesia is now 

The Silesia article DO need some serious improvement if we want it to be the valuable and reliable resource for the internet users. The current (restored and protected) version contains so many errors that it will chase away people with basic historical knowledge, if it's not changed as soon as possible.

1) First I suggest that we write what Silesia is now (as this is most interesting to the reader), and not what is was in the past. Silesia rich history should be discussed in the history section.

2) It is unacceptable to state that Silesia lies between Odra and Vistula rivers. First look at any map will show you that Silesia lies along the Odra river.

3) Silesia lies today in Poland and Czech Republic. It is doubtful if the Goerlitz area is part of Silesia. It is a historical part of Lusatia, and was joined to the Silesian province after 1816.

4) Im my opinion we should not discuss Silesian history in the intro paragraph, but we decide to, it is unacceptable to mention only the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation

5) I do not care in what order the language-names of Silesia are mentioned, but I do insist that the Silesian version (Ślónsk, Ślunsk) is included in this list. 

6) I do insist that the various nationalities and ethnic groups living know in SIlesia, are mentioned clearly and the list should include at least: the Silesians, the Poles, the Germans, the Czechs

7) The theories about the name of the region must be clearly marked as theories and not as facts. The passages need some minor rewrite.

8) The remarks about HRE overlordship in 1146 and 1163 are simply false, no longer upheld by the German historians, and must be removed

9) Great care must be taken when dealing with Silesian history, for example the rude remarks about devastation was caused by Hussite rebellion must be rewritten using neutral words

10) The Silesia article need more sections on the People, Economy, Culture, Education, Science and Tourism.

 Northern Cyprus edits 

I will complement you on doing a great job updating and expanding many Northern Cyprus-related articles.

I oppose, however, to your sneaky removal of links to Cyprus / Island of Cyprus / Republic of Cyprus, usually replacing them with links to Northern Cyprus, sometimes even making double or triple links to NC to avoid linking to the island of / Republic of Cyprus. I also notice that all your newly created articles about places in NC do not have any mentions at all about  RoC, not even the de jure/de facto distinction. That is definitely POV editing.

I oppose also to your consistent removal of any mention of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, replacing any mention with """"the events of 1974"""" or your new favorite """"the hostilities of 1974"""". These euphemisms do not give any information to the user of Wikipedia, they only create questions: """"Which events?"""", """"Which hostilities?"""". You have also been removing many sourced descriptions of the local effects of the 1974 ínvasion. These edits are definitely disruptive POV edits.

In your edit summaries you never mention the removals and changes you do to the article content, you only mention additions of mayors, population figures etc., which are obviously good additions. The disruptive edits I have mentioned above are never mentioned (which is why I used the word """"sneaky""""). To make it even worse, you are using false edit summaries. When you remove a category you do not like with an edit summary """"syntax"""", it is not only disruptive, it is plain dishonest.

In a week's time I will again be able to edit regularly in Wikipedia, and I will then begin to revert your POV edits. In the meantime you could help, by reverting your worst POV edits. If not, the least you can do is to refrain from any more POV edits with dishonest edit summaries.

I really think that it would be possible for us to work together to create a neutral (WP:NPOV) presentation of places in NC, but that would require that you are willing to accept that your personal POV is not necessarily the only way to describe the world. Regards!   """,[],0

What evidence is there for any concepts?  Again, none of this debate really matters in the absence of sources.  What specific sources support specific TCM concepts?  What sources support """"cold herbs"""" having antibiotic or anti-inflammatory properties?  What sources support a """"heat pattern"""" being inflammation (aside from the trivial observation that inflamed areas are warm)?  Without sources, these abstract discussions are pretty pointless.  If a reliable source echoes your assertion, for me the only real question becomes how to summarize it.
The assertion that TCM is speaking a different language rather than simply """"right by accident"""" is also an assertion that requires a source.  All prescientific medicine usually manages to be correct about certain herbs, be they emetics, analgesics, laxatives or soporifics, but that doesn't validate the medical system.  And if we're debating the modern medical model, when modern medicine was introduced to China I believe that, like all nations, they experienced a considerable boom in longevity, a drop in infectious diseases and a much higher rate of survival out of childhood.  Mao brought back TCM for political reasons, not because it was as effective as vaccinations, surgery and drugs.

What you were up to, you mean. From the beginning you're personally attacking me and harassing me, and this is the only way you found to try to claim ownership of articles.
And yes, it's highly suspicious that you seem to monitor everything that happens between the IP and me. At worst, it shows that you're actually tracking down my edits, ie harassing me, at best, it proves you are the IP because without any communication with me or the IP, there is no way you can be aware of anything in so much details(unless you're harassing me). And no, that you happen to hear about this matter right after it occured, while nothing suggested you were active here for 2 days, cannot be coincidence.
And finally, please, Buspar, stop playing on words. This is what the admin that took in charge your SSP case stated, and nothing else: """"Looking at contribs, User:Buspar and User:Xuanwu are very probably the same user. Technically, they cannot be socks, as one username was created after the other stopped editing"""". 
This statement is based on the technical definition of sockpuppetry, meaning that a person is using different identities at the same time. The admin only noted that the 2 accounts were not used simultaneously, but nonetheless acknowledged that Buspar and Xuanwu were the same person (""""Looking at contribs, User:Buspar and User:Xuanwu are very probably the same user."""")
The admin, however, never confirmed that you were not the IPs Onethirtyeightdot suspected you to be. If you've seen the line """"No, Buspar is not 130.49.157.75"""", then please source it correctly.

So, what do we have ? An admin confirming you're likely to use several identities, an anonymous IP acting in exactly the same way as you do, having the same personal issues with me, editing the very same articles as you do, reverting back into articles the very same contribs that you made, and it also seems both you and the IP seem to have a telepathic link allowing to know every issue occuring with the IP without you being contacted by it beforehand.

As I've said, I'm offering to peacefully resolve this problem. 
I am sincerely convinced that Buspar is the IP, because I've noticed the very same edit pattern, because both users contribute to the same articles, and both users seem to have a personal issue against me and both seem to systematically revert my contributions as soon as they concern article about illegal downloading.
Thus, this is not randmon bad faithed accusation. This is only what I sincerely believe.

However, if it is absolutely proved that Buspar and the Ip are not the same and that Buspar and the IP don't behave in similar ways, then I'm ready to make excuses to both users and to stop identifying the Ip as Buspar. 

But if someone has any doubts about the IP identity, or if someone clearly acknowledge that Buspar and the Ip have the very same behavior and edit pattern, then that's all I need. I won't continue to call the IP Buspar, on the condition that an admin clearly acknowledges the IP¨as being Buspar, and that Buspar in his future edits, only revert edits of mine and talk to me under his Buspar username.

Just to support ClaretAsh's positions, remember Wikipedia is an encyclopedia which tries to be neutral and factual.

Looks like the criticism content has been removed again and replaced with solely an environmental impact section. There are other issues besides environmental ones. A study done by some British company found that aviation primary RADAR systems have difficulty handling windfarms as the constantly rotating turbines cause the RADAR to pick up an intrusive object. There are complex ways of eliminating this problem but at the moment it is being cited by aviation safety organisations that wind farms pose a significant risk to their industry. I would also argue that the title is misleading as the intermittent nature of wind and the economic cost of wind turbines are not environmental issues.,[],0

Ernie Smith writes Æµ§œš1

Æµ§œš1, you state or pose as an interrogative; “So what you are saying is that OUSD was addressing """"Ebonics"""" as being defined as i or ii, and specifically and overtly excluding iii.”  In reply sentence, I say, I am saying what I have said and I reiterate it here; """"the proponents of the term Ebonics view and use the word Ebonics only one way.  That way being; from an Africa centered comparative linguistic perspective”.   I have said and I reiterate it here; “... As defined by Robert Williams the word Ebonics posits an Afrocentric view relative the origin and historical development of the language of descendants of enslaved Africans in America and throughout the diaspora. The view that the language of descendants enslaved Africans in America and throughout the diaspora is a dialect of English or some other European language is a non Afrocentric view and it has nothing to do with Ebonics”.   In other words Æµ§œš1, there are ‘proponents of Ebonics’ and are ‘anti-proponents of Ebonics’.  The proponents of Ebonics are those who view and use the word Ebonics from an Africa centered comparative linguistic perspective.   The 'anti-propronents of Ebonics' are those who do not use view and use the word Ebonics from an Africa centered comparative linguistic perspective.  The parents of the children of African ancestry in the OUSD for which the OUSD Board passed the resolution in 1996 were parents who are ‘proponents of Ebonics’.  That is, they are parents who view and use the word Ebonics from an Africa centered comparative linguistic perspective.   I have said and and I reiterate here;  “the OUSD Board's December 18, 1996, resolution was not about children who speak African American Vernacular English, Black English or any other appellation that implies inherently that the English language is the home, native or primary language of the parents and children that were the specific basis for the Oakland Unified School Districts (OUSD) resolution.  The OUSD December 18, 1996 resolution was concerning children whose parents had identified their home, native or primary language as (1) """"Ebonics"""", (2) """"Pan African Communication Behaviors"""" and/or (3) """"African Language Systems"""".  I say, Wikipedia article that posits the OUSD resolution was about African American Vernacular English is a outright lie.  

You state or pose as an interrogative Æµ§œš1; “So what you are saying is that OUSD was addressing """"Ebonics"""" as being defined as i or ii, and specifically and overtly excluding iii.”  In reply, I say what I have said and I reiterate it here;  the view that Baugh posits as Afrocentric view number (iii) is not Afrocentric at all.  I have said and I reiterate here, the view that Ebonics “is the equivalent of black English and is considered to be a dialect of English"""" (and thus merely an alternative term for African American Vernacular English|AAVE” is Eurocentric”.  I have said and I reiterate here, the other three views that Baugh posits as being the view of Afrocentric proponents of Ebonics, i.e., views  (i), (ii) and (iv), are Afrocentric.  Given that I did in fact include view number (iv) as an Afrocentric view I am at a loss to understand why you have excluded view number (iv) from what I have said concerning the OUSD resolution.   You should know that I'm suspicious of your having ommited view number (iv).  For view number (iv), i.e., the view that Ebonics “is the antonym of black English and is considered to be a language other than English"""" (and thus a rejection of the notion of """"African American Vernacular English"""" but nevertheless a term for what others term AAVE, viewed as an independent language and not a mere ethnolect)"""" is what was expressly being supported in the OUSD resolution.    

Now, with regards to your interroagative concerning whether the first paragraph of the OUSD Policy Statement  “could be interpreted as meaning that parents don't have to endorse the controversial classification to accept the services offered”.  My reply is; the OUSD Policy Statement was explictly informing the hog maws and hot souce eating Negro parents in the OUSD who are uncomfortable with their Afrcian ancestry and do not or did not indentify their child’s or childern’s home, primary or native language as Ebonics or as an African language system that the resolution does not pertain to them.  The OUSD Policy Statement was explictly informing the hog maws and hot souce eating Negro parents in the OUSD are uncofortable with their Afrcian ancestry and do or did not indentify their childrens’ home, primary or native language as Ebonics or as an African language system that, if they believe their home, primary or native language is English, Non standard English, Black English or African American Vecaular English (i.e., the language slaves or dogs born in the master’s house) they can continue receiving the Special Education, Speech Pathology a",[],0

Case in point, you write a profile in AppArmor, I come along and symlink the resource you're trying to protect, and BAM, I have just rooted your box...AppArmor is as much protection from being hacked or from a malicious local user, as putting a wet paper bag over your head while a nuclear bomb is going off.

Another thing Noobuntu is infamous for is crippling SU (substitute user), sudo on a server is unwieldy and selling sudo on security is basically snake oil, Ubuntu sets you up with root-like permissions anyway, and doesn't make any attempt to tech you how to limit other users access to the system appropriately.

Review of 1984 version

Here is a copyrighted review or summary:

In 1984, the movie The Bounty starring Anthony Hopkins as Bligh and Mel Gibson as Christian was released. The movie is set during the trial of Lt. William Bligh upon arriving home after the mutiny had occurred. In this movie, the events of the voyage up to and after the mutiny are shown as a series of flashbacks.

Bligh is not so much portrayed as a cruel tyrant in this film, but rather as a traditional ship's captain - a man of his times. While some savage beatings were carried out under Bligh's watch in this film, it seems to be in this film no different than any other captain would have done.

The crew is shown in a different light than in the previous two films. They are shown to be a much more """"rough and tumble"""" group than the crews in the other films. Many of them are shown as typical sailors of the time. Their motivations in this film are not always as noble as in the other two films.

In this film, Fletcher Christian is a more complex character. He is shown at first as a friend of Bligh. At first Bligh thinks so much of Christian that he asks the man to sail with him for a second time. However over the course of the film both men turn against each other. The feelings become much more acrimonius after the ship leaves Tahiti after Fletcher has been forced to leave his wife behind on Tahiti. In this film, she is more of a reason that Fletcher mutinied than in the previous two films. Afterwards, Fletcher is shown as feeling remorseful because of the mutiny. He tells another mutineer that he wished he had given Bligh some muskets.

In this film, the crew is shown as having more responsibility than they did in other films. This film does not so much hold Bligh as responsible - rather it is the desire of some of the crew to go back to Tahiti. However, it does make the fact that Bligh was going to try circumnavigation as one of the reasons that some of the crew decided to mutiny.

Like the 1935 film, this version also concentrates on the trials of Bligh and those who were forced into the launch with him. It is the only film to show that one man died because of an attack by the natives of an island where the launch stopped.  Once Bligh's launch reaches a Dutch colony, his part in the story comes to an end. It shows the later voyages of the Bounty as they go to Pitcairn Island. It then goes to Bligh's trial where he is subsequently acquitted by the Admirality.

The 1984 film was probably one of the more historically accurate of the films dealing with the Bounty. It shows both Bligh and the crew as more products of their time than anything else. This film also suggests that the motives behind the mutiny might not have been as noble as suggested in the other films. It also portrays the natives mostly nude as they would have appeared at the time of The Bounty's visit to the island (the previous films couldn't portray this because of censorship and decency concerns).

Despite the distinguished cast—including Daniel Day-Lewis and Liam Neeson in supporting roles and Laurence Olivier in a cameo appearance as Admiral Hood—the film had a tepid critical reception (the capsule review in Newsday read in its entirety as follows: """"Man the bilge pumps"""") and was not a great commercial success.

Hey AzaToth and others, right now I'm waiting on hearing back from legal on a few points, and I just made some internal pokes again.

Another Italian veteran discovered

Greetings, Mr. Giovanni Alunni has reported the discovery of another Italian WWI veteran. As I argued in 2004, we should first focus on the 'oldest' veterans, then the 'last.' Only with the deaths in the last year of George Johnson, 112; Maurice Floquet, 111; Ernest Pusey, 111; Moses Hardy, 113; Emiliano Mercado Del Toro, 115; and Antonio Todde, 110 has the focus shifted from 'oldest' to 'last.' Mr. Allingham is all alone from 1896; his chances of being the last veteran are slim to none. Most likely, disappointing or not, the last veteran will be some underage kid who never served in combat and born in 1901 or later. Or just maybe someone from 1900. Given that we have three 109-year-olds in France but no veterans from 1900, I still think it is quite possible that more French WWI vets will be discovered. We will likely see a few more (maybe 1-3) from Italy, Germany, the US, France, and Poland. {yakłtalk} """,[],0

"Answer: You use the date July 20 of 1599 AD as Thot 1 and retreat one date back every 4 years, or 30 days back in 120 years. Example, 240 years is 60 days back to May 21 of 1839 AD, or Apr 21 of 1959 AD, then add 13 days in our 1900 or 2000 century to have Gregorian May 4 in 1959 AD. Another 44 years to 2003 AD and 11 leap days takes all the dates back to April 23. Then 2004-2007 is April 22. In reply to the post below which says the Coptic calendar is not Egyptian, the answer is our September 11 as Thot 1 is Julian August 29. Though the Coptic calendar (Egyptian with leap days) was accepted in 284 AD (which Era of Diocletion is the Era of Christian Martyrs so coincidentally the year 6000 of Adam in the Jewish book of Josephus published in Rome), this calendar leap day was created in 27 BC by Augustus Octavius Caesar who inaugurated it in 25 BC when Thoht 1 becomes August 29. Therefore, the Coptic calendar is Julian (not Gregorian). Events against America have been on Egyptian dates. The August 2 invasion of Kuwait is Julian July 20 and the invasion takes place at 30 degrees where the rise of Sothis occurs on that date only at that latitude; this implying Saddam chose the rise to invade. However, they felt world trade controlling oil was USA blame. Another date is Thoth 1 was Feb 26 in 747 BC. In 1993 the world trade was bombed on Gregorian Feb 26 not taking into account that Julian Feb 26 is March 11 (March 10 in leap year). The Coptic calendar honors this date as the half year placing Pamenot 1 on March 10 and the internet terrorists attempt to destroy world trade by constantly revising the March 10 virus.",[],0

As for American Indians being a descendent of the Jews (Book of Mormon people), that is also not quite true.

I agree with your ideas about comprehensible articles on physics. I was a physics major in a major university for a couple years, eventually broadened out to other things, but I can still read Pauli and Reichenbach without feeling that I got caught in the spin cycle of a rug washer. The same isn't true of the Wikipedia physics articles.

I've tried to clear up the philosophy of QM article that is under rfd, but Mr. Ingham has not answered my questions about what he is trying to say in a responsive way. The """"simplified"""" article looks like a better place to start.

My experience in physics at the University level may be relevant. We had a trimester system. The first trimester was mechanics. I did o.k., but calculus was new to me. The second semester was electricity. Since I had shocked myself working on old radios, made crystal radios, etc., etc. for years, I already knew what was going on. In some ways I was ahead of our grad student lab leader, who couldn't understand why putting one probe of a volt meter into the DC outlet on the lab bench did not produce a reading. My grade jumped to A, not because I was any smarter, but because I knew from experience what happens when resistors are wired in series and when they are wired in parallel, and to other students such matters were totally abstract. I think that students should begin with real-world experiences as much as possible. Unfortunately, many students live in very restricted environments.

 Replaceable fair use Image:Andrzej Tomasz Zapałowski.jpg

I noticed the 'image' page specifies that the image is being used under fair use, but its use in Wikipedia articles fails our first fair use criterion in that it illustrates a subject for which a freely licensed image could reasonably be found or created that provides substantially the same information. If you believe this image is not replaceable, please:

 Go to the image description page and edit it to add , without deleting the original Replaceable fair use template.
 On the image discussion page, write the reason why this image is not replaceable at all.

Alternatively, you can also choose to replace the fair use image by finding a freely licensed image of its subject, requesting that the copyright holder release this (or a similar) image under a free license, or by taking a picture of it yourself.

"""

Well, first, I reject the whole """"suitable for a general encyclopedia"""" argument, because it's just not relevant.  Wikipedia is MORE than that, because it is not subject to the constraints that have bound traditional encyclopedias.  Size is irrelevant; I've got a half terabyte external USB drive on the Linux server across the room that is smaller and lighter than a paperback (well, Cryptonomicon at least).  Assuming good bitonal TIFF document images, that will hold 5 million scanned pages; assuming moderately compact text files (PalmOS reader format) that jumps to 250 million pages.  Printing costs are also irrelevant, since it's not printed, as are writing costs (monetary and temporal), as the labor force is both free and unbounded in size.  So it's back to first principles...
The definition of """"encyclopedia"""" is a book or set of books containing articles on various topics, usually in alphabetical arrangement, covering all branches of knowledge or, less commonly, all aspects of one subject (Dictionary.com Unabridged (v 1.1)).  Since Wikipedia is unbound by the constraints of other encyclopeidas, then I truly believe that it should cover all branches of knowledge, and cover them far more thoroughly than has heretofore been possible.  As far as sysadmin topics go, Wikipedia failed me this week; if the article on Domain Name System had even so much as a link to resolv.conf, I could have save myself a lot of digging when I set up that Linux system.  In fact, I'll probably do just that, along with showing the file format of resolv.conf to that article, now that I've figured it out.  Why?  Because it's useful information that I needed and failed to find when I looked for it.  It's not quite """"narrating the process"""", but it certainly is within the scope of an article on the DNS process to describe the steps taken by each part, and one of those steps would be """"the client checks the list of DNS servers (see resolv.conf etc.) to determine which name server to consult""""; that's all I would have needed to find the information I needed to solve my problem.
As Jimmy Wales said, Our goal...is to get a free encyclopedia to every single person on the planet. ...empowering people everywhere to have the information they need to make good decisions.  That's my guiding principle when I work on Wikipedia, and I feel that the accurizing article fits that perfectly.   """,[],0

 Smile! 


Smile a little, smile a little, all along the road;
Every life must have its burden, every heart its load.
Why sit down in gloom and darkness with your grief to sup?
As you drink Fate's bitter tonic, smile across the cup.

Smile upon the troubled pilgrims whom you pass and meet;
Frowns are thorns, and smiles are blossoms, oft for weary feet.
Do not make the way seem harder by a sullen face;
Smile a little, smile a little, brighten up the place.

Smile upon your undone labour; not for one who grieves
O'er his task waits wealth or glory; he who smiles achieves.
Though you meet with loss and sorrow in the passing years,
Smile a little, smile a little... even through your tears!

First, until 3 weeks ago, I had never heard the term, """"meat puppet"""".   Perhaps you're trying to make the term mean exactly what you want it to mean, no more and no less.  (Shades of Alice in Wonderland, I suppose.)  I will have to find the definition of that term.  But I view it as a problem when self-selected, biased individuals (even if there is no actual coordination involved) seem to coordinate their postings.  Dodo ran away, that's a fact.  He didn't address my actual criticisms of his actions:  he simply threw a few templates, as if that was the end of the argument.  (But, those templates were not merely mis-applied, they also did not address the entire subjects of the dispute.)  Dodo couldn't be bothered to address them, and for a 'good' (at least, for him!) reason:  If Dodo had to actually discuss his misconduct, and debate the propriety not merely of the original post, but also his own misdeeds, then Dodo would be so busy he couldn't continue his 'drive-by reversions' of peoples' articles.  Dodo was unwilling to explain why he deleted all of my edits, repeatedly.  He was unwilling to explain why he didn't wait for consensus.  Etc.
And, it is a fact that 'nobody' addressed Dodo's (at least arguable) misconduct, even if (hypothetically) they also objected to something I did, too.  Why should that be?  There's an 'excellent' reason:  I think the kind of people who did post (self-selected, of course, one would expect) may very well have felt they were defending 'one of their own'.  I repeat my point that if I had time (and access to reversion/deletion statistics) it would probably be obvious that those persons who felt the need to speak up generally engaged in a pattern of activity similar to that of Dodo: Revert, Revert, Revert!   And, not to bother with any 'consensus'.  (""""We don't need no stinkin' consensus!"""").  Such persons would be fearful of 'outing' Dodo's pattern of action, and similarly fearful of someday being hit with similar criticism.  Am I wrong?  I invite somebody else to study their statistics, and explain why there's no 'pattern' there.

I actually had some extended discussion on this topic previously, with a Muslim editor. He assured me (and provided some credible refs from the Sharia) that Islam acknowledges Jesus' status as a prophet and respects him accordingly, but it is against fundamental teachings (and even court rulings) to celebrate the birthday of a prophet. I had originally wanted to include the material on the basis of NPOV, but he convinced me that it's either a fabrication, or taken out of context and distorted. The discussion and refs are in the archives (probably late Oct. - early Nov. somewhere). Since then I've been removing the material (it pops up fairly often) because the part that is verifiable isn't relevant to the article, and the part that's relevant is not only unverified, but strongly disputed.

He is now mostly retired and owns a small company, Bear Mountain Scientific, that he uses to fulfill various types of writing contracts. His company web site is BearMountainScientific.com.
Publications: Vernon R. Harris has published three books as of August, 2009. They are:
The Travelers - The Travelers, is a fiction story about a couple, Ray and Sue Barker, visiting a new town during a vacation where they met a very unusual couple one day. The couple they met is referred to as “The Travelers,” and their names were Carl and Collie. Ray and Sue visited with The Travelers for a while and even had lunch with them. What they learned about The Travelers and their backgrounds left Ray and Sue almost speechless. This is the story about the Travelers and their strange tales. It is a story of visitors or travelers from another planet but with a totally different twist. Those readers of the Christian faith will find this story especially interesting. Those readers who are science buffs or scientists will find this story very intriguing. Is the story of The Travelers possibly real, and not just fiction? Listen to the facts as they unfold, and you decide. ISBN:  978-1-61582-414-4

The Cats of Coward County - The Cats of Coward County is a fictional story about a scientific experiment that accidentally resulted in a group of cats developing some human like characteristics. Since they were cats first, their cat personality was dominate but they were able to develop new skills, and memories, and, they could talk. These are some of the humorous stories involved with this group of cats that try so hard to organize and develop their own little town, a town called """"Cat City.” The personality and humorous antics of each cat living in Cat City comes to life as the stories unfold. Mouser, a real cat, is fictionalized as the Father of Cat City and is recognized as the Mayor of the town and attempts to guide the other cats in the development of their town and solving it's many problems. The many stories are filled with humor showing how the cats dealt with their new found thoughts that are filled with both human and cat memories. You will be introduced to Cat City, how it got started, what it looks like, and how the cats make it work for them. You will get to know Vern and Pam who helped the cats get their town started and how they helped the cats organize all the different parts of their town. Vern and Pam, who lived close by, got involved only when it was absolutely necessary. We hope you enjoy meeting all the cats. The Cats of Coward County is designed to add a new perspective to your imagination and a sense of humor and how cats might evolve in these circumstances. ISBN: 978-1-61582-406-9

Sweet Water Canyon - Sweet Water Canyon is a fictional story about the trek of a group of pioneers crossing the country in 1859 from a Midwestern town and going west. They traveled together in a wagon train. Dozens of wagon trains had already made it across the country and had pretty well marked the way, if there is such a thing, for those that followed. They traveled by wagon train because the promised railroad going from east to west was far behind schedule and seemed like a distant, hope. It describes one type of hardship and danger the early pioneers had to endure. This is the story of one part of one journey and the impact it had on the entire wagon train. Readers of the Christian faith will find this story especially interesting. ISBN: 978-1-61582-405-2

Hmmmm,

I believe that most of the American Churches have dropped the """"Mission"""" part of the title because it was simply was not true anymore. The name is probably still in use in Africa. Legally, most of our American churches go by """"Apostolic Faith Church,"""" with some churches adding the word Trinity to distinguish our organization from others. In regard to Joe Bishop's sermon on Biblical modesty, I thinkI'm fairly certainI know exactly which sermon you're talking about. I thoroughly enjoyed it myself. There are some copies floating around. I know a few people that have them.

You're absolutely rightmy age does limit my experience. But I think, to be fair, your experience limits your objectivity. A few people have asked me about this Wikipedia page, and my response to them has been along the lines of """"it doesn't really need that much fixing."""" I'm not interesting in changing the majority of what you've written. The only thing that concerns me
is the spin, the anti-AF opinion that runs through the factual accounts. Every historian operates through a unique lens of perspective, and the lens you're looking through is tainted by someI imaginevery painful experiences. 

I've had offers of help, and I've turned them down. Since the only work of note that I have really put into the article amounts to the altering or deletion of about six phrases, I didn't think it would be worth mustering the Apostolic Forces. It's not my place or desire to create an historical account for the world to look at. Perhaps this is laziness excused, but I feel that if the organization was concerned about the encyclopedic content available through Wikipediaand I think that it should besome committee or pastor or minister or historian should get on and take care of it. (Fact is, I'd guess that most of our AF leaders probably aren't aware of just how widely-spread Wikipedia is used, and if they did, they would probably do something about itif someone also told them they were allowed to. We're not exactly on the cutting edge of technology.) I'm sure that whatever I wrote, or however I wrote it, someone somewhere would disagree. Probably many someones. Which is another reason why I've greatly limited my input.

If I asked you to verify all your encyclopedic content, how much information would be left that isn't rooted in undocumentable or unverifiable personal experience? I think large portions would be missing from the """"church doctrines and teachings"""" sectionthough I did not delete them, because I know that, while not verifiable or encyclopedic, most of what has been written is factually accurate. Is that what Wikipedia is for, though? Unverifiable facts?

One last question, about the alteration you made to my alteration regarding dancing. What dancing are you referring to as being prohibited? Dancing privately? Slow-dancing in a ballroom? School dances? Because there are different attitudes regarding all of those, among many different people, and I'm not sure what you mean by """"dancing was prohibited through 2000."""" What kind, and by what verifiable source?

 biography of Lazar Kaganovich 

a Nice read from a fascinating book for those who deny Kaganovich is one of the worst mass murderers in history and edit it my post defending him. Maybe some information can be added to the page?

Lazar Kaganovich, one of the bloodiest of the communist butchers during the 1930s and 1940s and the number-two man in the Kremlin for many years. 

The book is The Wolf of the Kremlin, and it was written by Stuart Kahan, an American Jew who is Kaganovich's nephew. Kahan went to the Soviet Union in 1981 and interviewed his uncle extensively  in Yiddish  to write this biography, and it is a goldmine of revelations.

To sum it up, Lazar Kaganovich was a Jew raised in the Jewish tradition, a yeshiva boy taught to guide himself on the basis of doing always what is best for the Jews, and this precept actually is cited explicitly several times in the book. He attended his first Communist Party meeting in 1911, when he was 18, to hear the Jewish communist Trotsky give a speech in a synagogue in Kiev; that's right: in a synagogue. He rose rapidly in the inner circle of the Communist Party. His success was due primarily to his aggressiveness and his ruthlessness. In his communist activity he held back from nothing, no matter how brutal or bloody. He even killed his fellow Jews when they got in his way. He was a gangster among gangsters.

In 1930 Kaganovich organized a special department of the Soviet secret police, with himself as the head. It was referred to as the department of """"wet affairs,"""" with """"wet"""" meaning """"bloody."""" That is, it handled clandestine mass executions, of the sort carried out later at Vinnitsa in Ukraine and at Katyn in Russia and at a thousand other places throughout the Soviet Union over the next two decades. Kaganovich became the commissar in charge of mass murder. Yet when the German Army invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, it was Kaganovich who was the savior of the Jews: he arranged for the evacuation of all Jews from the frontier areas and their resettlement far to the east, where they would be safe from the Germans. Let the Ukrainians and the Russians bear the brunt of the German invasion, but protect the Jews from hardship and danger at any cost.

When the Gentile communist Nikita Khruschev accused Kaganovich in 1957 at a Soviet Party Congress of having murdered 20 million Russians during his career, Kaganovich didn't even deny it. He only accused Khruschev of being a murderer too. """"Your hands are blood-stained too,"""" Kaganovich told him. Khruschev pointed out that the difference was that he, Khruschev, had merely followed Kaganovich's orders, while it had been Kaganovich who had formulated the policies of mass murder and had given the orders for carrying out those policies.

As I said, it's a fascinating book, this biography of Lazar Kaganovich, and if you really want to gain some insight into his mentality, you should read it for yourself. 

Kaganovich wants to boast about the power he once held, and at the same time he wants to evade responsibility for his crimes, and one can see this ambivalent attitude throughout the book.

Yours,

Mutual masturbation has nothing to do with masturbation, it is non-penetrative sex. The word """"masturbation"""" is only used as a euphemism, just because handjob and fingering are similar to the way a male or famale masturbates. Mutual masturbation is actually handjob and fingering, which of course is non-penetrative sex, not masturbation! Mutual masturbation is not about two people sitting opposite to each other and masturbating without touching one another, this is nonsense! If no contact exists, this is simple masturbation, no matter how close two persons are to each other. No contact = Masturbation.

You wrote:
The term proto-Protestants has been in use now for quite a long time to describe religious movements sharing the beliefs very similar or even identical (as far as key issues are concerned) to those professed by Protestants of the 16the century. 

I was unable to find this definition online can you post a link.

Continued:
There clearly is a group of such movements, including the Waldensians, the Lollards, the Hussites, but also in the earlier centuries, the Vigilantians, the Aerians, the Helvidians, the Jovinians, whose views were identical to those of many Protestants.

I don't know that it is all that clear. Identical? Aerians insisted that the observance of Easter was a Jewish superstition and they fasted on Sundays. Not very Protestant. The Vigilantians argued against the veneration of relics, the sending of alms to Jerusalem, the rejection of earthly goods and the attribution of special virtue to the unmarried state, especially in the case of the clergy. No mention of the Bible, no mention of justification, nothing else Protestant. All that is known about Helvidius is that he did not believe in the Virgin Mary.  That doesn't exactly make him a Protestant. Identical is laughable - there is no evidence to back up such an assertion. Wikipedia is not about truth, it is for fact that can be cited with recognized secondary sources of evidence.

You went on:
This becomes even more obvious when we consider the fact, that the Waldensians, the Lollards and the Hussites joined the Reformation and often mixed with various Protestant groups. The Waldensian Church, still existing in Italy, is considered a Protestant group and not a sect, as User:Secisek tries to imply. This is because all key beliefs the Waldensians have professed since the 12th century are common to most Protestant groups and are different from those professed by sects considered heretical by both the Catholics and the Protestants.

Whoa, I did not imply they were a sect, I wrote that they were. I intended no offense with that word. The Waldensians were a sect, and they revised their doctrine at the Reformation to conform to the new Protestant thinking. This is taken from the Waldensian's article:

""""In 1532 they met with German and Swiss Protestants and ultimately adapted their beliefs to those of the Reformed Church. Moreover, the Waldensian absorption into Protestantism led to their transformation from a sect on the edge of Catholicism that shared many Catholic beliefs into a Protestant church adhering to the theology of John Calvin, which differed much from the beliefs of Peter Waldo. From that moment the Church became the Italian branch of Reformed churches.""""

This contradict your assertion:
The Waldensians have never altered their key beliefs, they are considered Protestants and still they had existed for over 3 centuries before the proper Protestants and the Reformation. Many scholars have used the term proto-Protestants in their articles, although there do exist historians who argue that the term should not be in use for various reasons.

The fact is, they have altered their key beliefs - that is what made them Protestant.

The problem is, however, that the Catholic historians often argue against the term to show that Protestants appeared only in the 16th century, while before them, there was just one Church of Christs and many small sects. For this reason even Waldensians, now considered a part of the Protestant Church even by the Church of Rome, are called a sect by Catholic historians. This dychotomy is absurd, as it implies that the Waldensians were at first a sect and then a Protestant group, while they have never changed their beliefs in the course of History. If the Waldensians are Protestants now, and they maintain the same views they professed in the late 12th century it means, that they have always been Protestants, even when the term had not been in use.

They have not maintained the same views, read the Waldensian article. They were still taking Roman Catholic Eucharist until the time of the Reformation, with the belief that the validity of the sacraments depends on the worthiness of the priest performing them. Seven sacrament is not very Protsestant.  

I am not a Roman Catholic, nor do I care what Roman Catholic historians argue, although I am sure RC historians would at least acknowledge the existance of the Orthodox and Oriental Churches rather then maintain that there was """"just one Church"""". The facts are quite clear - Protestants appeared in the 16th century for a variety of historical and cultural reasons that existed at that moment in history. They could not have appeared before that moment and it mental gerrymandering or wishful thinking to believe otherwise. I will be happy to discuss this further, but it seem that the",[],0

Okay, it is stated eventually, but not until the geometry section, and there only in the abstract language of linear algebra, putting the main point of rotation matrices out of reach of anyone except those who should know it already.

I'm hesitating to jump in and revise it, as I'm kind of new to linear algebra, but will probably go ahead and take a crack at it eventually if no one with more expertise wants to step up.

Of course I'm indef blocked. I pointed out that racism exists in Wikipedia. That is, by defniiton, an """"attack"""" and a """"battle."""". I pointed out that it can easily be connected to certain editors, including admins who patrol certain articles. That is, by definition, a personal attack. I pointed that admins are abusive and enjoy a double-standard. Again a personal attack! All the listed grounds for blocking here are judgement calls, so there is no contesting them, and hardly an incentive when the subject of my complaint is admins. The lone factual claim is wrong: I was not unblocked as Mindbunny for making any agreements. I made no compromises of any sort.

The fact is Isalmophobia began with a 8 paragraph section undermining the concept of Isalmophobia. Antisemtism has a few scattered sentences criticising the concept. We all know damn well that there is no chance that Antisemitism would ever look like Islamaphobia, and that the systemic resistance to making them EQUAL is substantial. That's """"systemic bias,"""" which is a euphemism for prejudice. It doesn't happen invisibly. Certain editors can be tied to it, and we all know some of them. We all know it is self-reinforcing: the bias alienates Muslims, Indonesians, Arabs, and other groups who are demographically non-English-speaking and have significant headwinds in gaining consensus on ideological subjects related to their ethnicity. Those who stick around get pissed, and get blocked, further reinforcing the bias. It makes an encycolpedia into a stupid power game to see whose prejudice will prevail.

Ultimately, I was blocked, charged with violating unknown-to-me 'rules' of Wikipedia, and otherwise censored, and rendered unable to contribute.  And, that, gentlemen, is what I've been complaining about for the past month here on Wikipedia.

It would be much better if the Wikipedians, with their vast experience of computer knowledge, particularly as it relates to being able to master Wikipedia, would stand aside and let those of us who actually have knowledge about the subject of nitrites and poppers make meaningful contributions to this page.

However, I suspect that will not be allowed to happen.

 MSM 

Agreed

Every single source I have and Puellanivis has referred to has said that TG/TS women are considered MSM or """"along side"""" MSM. The much vaunted CDC source made it sound even less ambigous.

Again, the answer from the CDC and from your sources is that the assumption is that MTF TS/TG are reported as MSM, and FTM are just pretty much ignored... N.B. assumption... since gender identity information isn't collected no one can say what it is.  Again, being that my medical records indicate me as female, and I continue to be asked """"are you pregnant?"""" when getting x-rays indicates that I would not be reported as a male to the CDC.

 Proposing renaming and new article draft 

Over the last couple of months I have produced a new draft of this article, working on behalf of New Leaders. The organization asked me to write an updated draft, better reflecting their new name and current programs and bringing the article into line with Wikipedia's guidelines. The most immediate issue with the current article is that the title is now incorrect. The organization has recently been renamed to """"New Leaders"""" and is now no longer """"New Leaders for New Schools"""". Due to this change, I believe that the article should be renamed.

I recognize that since I prepared my draft on behalf of New Leaders, I have a conflict of interest. So, before I make any changes, I'd like to ask that other editors read through my draft and my explanation here, and offer any feedback they might have. 

There are a number of problems with the current article, not least that it is rather promotional in tone. It seems that this has attracted the attention of editors in the past, as you can see from the warning tag. However, despite the warning tag, and the discussion that was opened by NDSteve10 on the Talk page (see above), there hasn't really been any improvement to the article in the last 12 months. No editors responded to the Talk page note, and only a few edits have been made. In fact, little has changed with the article since it was originally created in December 2009. 

The article currently has few citations, less than half of which are reliable secondary sources. The introduction doesn't adequately summarize the article, and certainly does not give a real sense of what New Leaders does. The most problematic sections are What it does and Educational impact, both of which are written in a promotional tone, especially the latter. In addition, the """"What it does"""" section is outdated, since the organization has since introduced new programs and initiatives. Meanwhile, the """"Educational impact"""" section provides a lot of detail, but would be better presented using Wikipedia's summary style. The information provided is cited to New Leaders' website, but makes no mention that the source of the claims is the organization itself.

I would like to propose a new draft of the article that addresses the issues with the current version, which you can view in my userspace:User:16912 Rhiannon/New Leaders

This is an entirely re-written article, using reliable secondary sources as much as possible, with new section headings to provide readers with a sense of the content at a glance, a new introduction which properly summarizes the article, and an infobox with all the key information about the organization fully up to date. The """"Creation and history"""" section now includes details of the organization's founding and expansion up to the present day. The descriptive information about New Leaders' has been removed, as this is more relevant in the new """"Function"""" section. The information from the current """"What it does"""" and """"Educational impact"""" sections has been rewritten under a new section heading of """"Function"""", which includes the organization's mission, its programs and its results. This section provides details of all the organization's current initiatives and an overview of the impact of these programs. I have retained the sections on """"Geographic reach"""" and """"Executive team"""", but updated the information in each and added citations. 

While I have put much effort into writing this from a neutral POV, I appreciate that due to my COI it may be that other editors have some changes to suggest. I welcome any productive feedback on the draft and my suggestion to rename the article to New Leaders. Please let me know if you have any thoughts or questions. Thanks,   """,[],0

No freedom of speech on wikipedia, and i am sure our fathers have fainted back there in Philadelphia after that statement.

Bigfoot

Welcome back. Like the Devil and Daniel Webster. True, the intro is a mess and it must be made clear that Bigfoot is not a proven zoological species, but is tentative, and unproven. But the search goes on for evidence. The extreme LENGTH of this search leads researchers, with or without PhDs, to speculate that there may be a""""Plan C"""" where the beings may be neither hoax, (too many sighitngs for that) nor zoological (no body) but instead may be a theoretical space-time creature. This has not yet been stated. It needs to be. Skeptical editors can relax and know that skeptics are correct, there is no zoological Bigfoot nor Yeti. But there is something else. This is being ignored and swept under the rug. Always remember that with no official funding, """"mainstream"""" science has no positive opinion on the topic, and the work goes on by unpaid PhDs and many amateurs, and one paid non-academic.

Now, we, the Six, on the BF Edit Committee in Berkeley, will edit and re edit, and revert 
until the end of time to get the true and correct word out to readers. We will NOT
go away. Editors would be well-advised to work with our suggestions, since we know the literature and most editors never cracked a book. They, except one or two, do not kow squat on the topic, and most are lost in the theoretical quagmire. Most, it seems,

Unjustified protection of an article

There is no use in attempting to run an objective and educational publication when the very people who have discredited the internet as a source of information are allowed to manipulate the site by sourcing the same intellectually dishonest sites that people use wikipedia to avoid. 

In short, explain yourselves- particularly Roland Rance, who has manipulated his position on this site to censor any points he disagrees with- all without explaining why. When you stop accepting the ridiculous assumption that senior members are beyond reproach, perhaps the site will gain some semblance of credibility. As it stands, wikipedia is just another example persistence winning over intelligence.",[],0

 Traditional or Simplified Chinese? 

I've moved this to a new section because it has become difficult to continue two topics in the same section. I would like to discuss what should be done about the issue of Traditional and Simplified Chinese in TW related articles (without discussing romanisation methods). My aim is just to get a consensus (either way), and not simply to push my ideas on wiki. I have tried posting similar topics in the HK page as well as the manual of style, but it seems hard to have an active discussion let alone get any real consensus. 

Why are we still including both sets in these articles?

Naturally I support removing simplified Chinese from TW related articles. It is just as misleading to include traditional chinese in the PRC article as it is to include simplified chinese in the ROC article. I am not talking about matters of race or cultural identity, but about de facto usage. Users in the pinyin section have argued (quite well) that hanyu pinyin should be included in ROC articles because it is used de facto, even in TW. So why then can't we eliminate simplified chinese from the TW related articles as TW's de facto standard is traditional chinese only? Wiki is not a chinese dictionary, so is there any reason to include TW and PRC's writing systems in the articles of the other? This doesn't have anything to do with anyone's personal views on """"one china"""" or """"two chinas"""", but rather is an issue of reflecting the language situation in both areas and cleaning up articles.

Bad LOGIC

=Progressivism
On the progressivism and economic progressivism pages  some editors have deleted criticism on the following grounds.

1.  The article needs to be expanded first.
2.  The article needs to be improved first.
3.  Criticsm section puts undo weight on negatives.

Well I say this logic leads to only one outcome, the articles purpose is to argue the point which is a violation of NPOV.

1.  If the article needs expanding, expand it...criticism also helps expand.  THe purpose of the article is to report all the facts not just the facts in favor of the article title.
2.  The article is improved just by including a criticism section.  Again, THe purpose of the article is to report all the facts not just the facts in favor of the article title. Deleting the criticism on the grounds that the article needs to be improved suggests the only way to improve the article is by aruging the point. Again, violation of NPOV.
3.  Criticism does not put undo weight on negatives. Again the purpose of the article is not to argue the point of progressivism but to report the facts.
4.  The fact is criticism exists and it should be reported.  The criticism section included an AUthor and his book.
5.  The addition of a pov original research counter arguement to the criticism further proves my point (And you can look on the history page) that they believe the purpose of the article is to argue the point rather than report the facts.

All were poorly reasoned excuses to delete material they objected to.  These editors are not trying to preserve the integrity of wikipedia or be """"Fair and balanced"""" they are simply trying to push a leftist political objective by censoring any alternative regardless of the source.

Classical Liberalism

Editor Slizor has deleted several sections and paragraphs which were cited and refrenced, including quotes from economists and think tanks on various things which Slizor has expressed disagreement with.  Dispite these citations, he deleted the material on the grounds that what he believes is the truth does not fit the facts provided.  He claims, dispite contradictory evidence and no evidence of his own that classical liberals have nothing in common with libertarians.  That classical liberals are not inheritors of liberalism.  and that modern liberals do not have a different understanding of liberalism than 200 years ago.  Furthermore, he makes the original research pov claim that classical liberals are more like elitist Republicans than libertarians (for which he has NO CITATION, and this is one of the grounds for the deletions).

This is just another example of the abuse some wiki editors will make up in order to push their own agenda.

The logic is poor.  The citation is non existant.  The pov is massive.  Slizor's edit needs a massive revert...and he needs to be drawn away from his computer and beaten with Milton Friedman and FA Hayek books until he understands the quotes from their books that he deleted.  ( )""",[],0

"I am sure that clarity would help; if only we could agree as to what one would say. The knub of the disagreement comes in the relationship between Acts and the letters. Long arguments have already taken place between those who, supported by scholars such as Conzelman, think Acts to have a comparatively low historical value, emphasising the hostility towards Judaism expressed in Galatians, and those who regard Scripture as consistent de fide so that any one statement must be reconcilable with any other. Critical scholarship makes the second view difficult to hold, though it is represented in the article. the statement about St. Paul's prctice would be controverted on precisely these grounds by a number of editors and, more important, by scholars. It is always hard for editors to cope with the fact that we are not, as a matter of WP policy in a position to say that anything is 'indefensible. That is POV - a point of view. We can say that this learned person or that has argued in this way or that. Whne I last looked at the article it nowhere suggested that St. Paul was a Judaizer; quite the contary as Peter Ballard writes.

"Hello!

During The Dangerous Tour in 1993 Michael Jackson had planned to visit Mexico. The initial dates for the concerts in Mexico City were planned to be as following: 29/10/1993, 31/10/1993, 2/11/1993, 4/11/1993 and 6/11/1993. The first 2 concerts were done as planned.

Now, Jackson had problems with his health and the last 3 concerts were postponed. The dates for the last three concerts were then set as following: 7/11/1993, 9/11/1993 and 11/11/1993.

There were also some minor plans to take Jackson also to Monterrey after Mexico City dates, but these plans were then cancelled, because Jackson cancelled the whole tour on November 12 because of ill health.

Now, please do not any more change the fourth Mexico City concert date! It was planned to take place on November 4, not November 3!! Please also read Lisa D. Campbell book, which has been mentioned in the article.

The answer, Monte Melkonian was a member and one of the main leaders of ASALA - Armenian Secret Army for Liberation of Armenia, which was considered as a terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department.

"Just look at the stuff about David Irving and how many times the author tries to smear this honourable historian, whose book 'Hitlers War' from 1977 was compulsery reading at West Point and Sandhurst. This really says a lot of the extent of authority as Mr. Irving enjoyed (then). He is still widely believed to be one of the greatest authorities on WW2 and of the nature of the Nazi regime. All this still stands, as everyone can witness for himself by reading some of his books, which are available free of charge from his website as Downloads.

However ONE chapter of the aforementioned book was about the holocaust. And because of that David got subjected to a smearing campaign hitherto unseen in scope. Booksellers was pressured not to sell his books (no mention of this on Wikipedia) - that is why he gives them away for free. Whereever he goes in the world he find arrangements cancelled ib short notice, the hotelliers or universities being pressed to pull the event.

I find David irving to be a good and honourable englishman. His father was naval officer who took part in The Battle of Jutland. You cannot find ANY factual fault in his work. If you can David is the first who wants to know - email him.

By the way, he do not deny the holocaust, which is why your Wikipedia entry is so wrong. He find the whole subject boring, but hardpresset he will tell you that it should be spelled with a small h as there were many holocausts, poles,russians,gypsies and others got killed. Civilians allways get caught out in war, but it is undeniable that the Nazi regime was especially brutal.

 To be a folk without a homeland living among a majority is allways a precaurious situation to be in in times of unrest, or so history has proven many times.

 Simon Charlton and Sealand national football team

The text does not mention Charlton but I have not watched or listened to the video, so I don't know if he's mentioned.

Should be treated like any other """"nation"""" not recognized by FIFA. If those are included, this should be too, as the NF-Board, who seems to be the next official thing, recognized this match. -

I hope the ground where the match was played made a few quid behind the bar, but DK has it correct, it's not a serious fixture and shouldn't be in the infobox. A sentence in the prose is fine, but that's all. cheers,   
It was an official NF-Board recognised match. I don't know what that means in terms of notability but looking at players of other NFB """"national"""" teams, there's about a 50-50 split to whether their caps are mentioned in the infobox. Dom 
Regardless of what we normally do with NF-Board countries, I don't have a problem in removing Sealand from the infobox as aspecial case. We are after all talking about a country with no grass or artificial turf, and a population of fewer than 11 people. —WFC—  """,[],0

If nothing else, you also need the page number, particularly when you are quoting (as you appeared to be doing in several places). You might be interested in looking at , specifically, and more generally Wikipedia:Citing sources. When adding material to article, please also read the text they already contain and work your material in such as to create a comprehensive whole.

I see from the above that there may be some concerns about the nature of the content that you are trying to add to the article as well. Please consider discussing these concerns with other editors at the talk page of the article, Talk:Haida. Wikipedia's articles are developed according to consensus of its contributors, and such conversation is a valuable part of reaching that consensus. Occasionally, where editors disagree, additional dispute resolution may be necessary.  (talk)",[],0

"I agree with Travellingcari. The tags serve a useful purpose, even after the article is brought to AfD, and especially so when they have been on the article for a significant length of time. They make it clear to visiting editors that any interested parties have had a fair chance to improve the article, and hadn't, which is often a point used in support of deletion. Conversely, if the article isn't tagged, it's not clear that interested parties have been given a chance to improve the article, which may be used to support a keep argument. Removing the tag makes the status either way less clear. Yes, it's available in the history, but why make editors go through the extra work of checking the history? In addition, an AfD can end without reaching a consensus, which means the tag most likely still applies and would have to be restored. No, the time to remove the tag is after a consensus has been reached at the AfD that the subject does meet the notability guidelines, i.e. after it is closed with result keep (or in some cases, when the eventual outcome is clear per WP:SNOW).

Actually, I am pretty sure for example Maris Verpakovskis real name is like that, because """"Maris"""" is even Latvian name. At least here in Lithuanian there are both Russians who uses their names as they'd use in Russia and who uses lituanised versions (with endings """"as"""" or """"is""""). Out of Russians who uses lituanised names, many are second or third generation; sometimes parents decides to give children lituanised version of name and surname in those cases, it happens especially in mixed families. E.g. one of Lithuanian football team players is Igoris Morinas; it would be wrong to change it to Igor Morin because Igoris Morinas is his real name. While, for example, real name of the mentioned poolitician is Viktor Uspaskich, not Viktoras Uspaskichas, therefore Viktor Uspaskich is and should be used (and is used that way in Lithuanian wikipedia too). As for Latvian football team, I am not really sure though, but I am sure that for example Verpakovskis is not Mariy Verpakovskiy or something. Maybe someone could shed more light on Latvian policy on names, maybe in Latvia it is different than here in Lithuania, or maybe Latvianisation of name is for example required to get citizenship?

If you wish to know what is in dispute read the talk page. You will find a very long discussion there are realize that the recent inactivity was due to several persons (including ISKapoo & Vikramsingh) giving up any hope of maintaining a balanced viewpoint due to the constant censorship of ITAQALLAH and others.
  
Are you sure you understand the tags you've put up? There is clearly no controversial or unsourced content in the article that  alludes to. This looks more like a heap of tags just to say you don't like the article as it stands. Neither you nor your colleagues have given any detailed reason why the removal of crankish, poorly sourced, fringe material contravenes WP:NPOV, and how the material isn't in violation of WP:BLP (whereas I have shown it is).  
Please stop vandalizing this article by removing the tags. Your behavior has become a burden on most wikipedians. -   
Please demonstrate that you understand the issues at hand and are not merely placing tags so as to register your personal grievances with the page. You can do so by actually explaining how the tags are justified and how the fringe material removed doesn't violate core content policies.  
User:Agnistus has claimed the neutrality of this article is disputed. That is legitimate. Now, I'd like to now what is it in the article that Agnistis finds to be a violation of WP:POV.

Thank you Agnistus for your anticipated cooperation.  
Dear , you do not know that the article is disputed? """"crankish, poorly sourced, fringe material"""" ???. The statements by Zakir Naik on the rights on non-muslims were properly sourced material of much importance to the article(to maintain a balanced viewpoint). You have repeatedly and continously indulged in deletion of this material. Your actions have constituted a blatant violation of WP:BLP. Read the 50-page long talk page and you will understand the reasons for the disputed status. You are probably blind to this gross censorship since you yourself were the censor. Until and unless a fully balanced viewpoint is presented (ofcourse in compliance with WP:BLP) in the article, the tag cannot be removed. BTW  , there is absolutely no necessity for a 24-hour window, as it is perfectly clear to any Non-Islamic fundamentalist from the talk page that this article is totally disputed.

Hello!  informed me that you were asking some questions about why the article you wrote, Offley Place, was speedy deleted. As I am the administrator who deleted it, I'll give you some brief rationale according to Wikipedia conventions and policies. I'm glad you have decided to contribute to Wikipedia, and I hope you continue to add to the project in the future. However, the article Offley Place as you wrote it met the criterion for deletion for two reasons:

The article did not indicate why the subject met the criteria for inclusion that apply to businesses and organizations.
It did not contain any verifiable, third-party references.
It was written in a promotional, rather than an encyclopedic tone. 
It appeared that the only contributor to the article (you) had a significant conflict of interest with the article subject. That is, it appears that your reason for adding the article to Wikipedia is to promote your business, rather than to improve the encyclopedic content of Wikipedia.

Though your first article did not meet the standards for inclusion in an encyclopedia, we hope that you will continue as an editor here.

Thanks for your compliments. I don't remember much more about Admiral Makarov than what I wrote in the stub. I agree with the need of consistency in transliteration. I think, however, that when some Russian term is already established in English, the established transliteration should take precedence of the letter by letter rule. My impression (not confirmed though a thorough search though) is that Kniaz iz a more common English usage of the Russian word Князь. However, the google counts for kniaz and knyaz are close enough, so my impression is rather subjective. Also, the article you refered me to gives two choices for transliteration of Великий as both Velikiy"""" or Veliky''. The former term seems better to me, but again this is rather subjective.

 Article Title 

Alright, I'm going to request another move be made to """"Big White (ski resort)"""", simply because I have been skiing and snowboarding there since I was 5 years old, and so has my family dating well back into the early eighties. Television, radio, and newspaper ads all refer to it simply as """"Big White"""", and the first thing that would come out of someone's mouth regarding the name would be """"Big White"""", not """"Big White Ski Resort"""". Wikipedia's naming conventions state that the most acceptable and commonly known name is the rightful one, so as long as it isn't misleading to the licensed or proper title. To be perfectly honest with you, I cannot recall anyone having the preference to call it """"Big White Ski Resort"""" when referring to it. It's known around British Columbia and Kelowna particularly as simply """"Big White"""". Besides, it's just the article's name, and within the article: """"Big White Ski Resort"""" will and should continue to remain, just not as the article's title. Refer to Billy the Kid.

Another response from Jmk

Thank you for finally looking into this.  Do you think I would be so adamant if I had something to hide vis a vis the clone/impersonation issue?  I will be very curious to see what your findings show, as I have my suspicions, but I will keep them to myself for now.  As I have repeatedly stated, the *only* anonymous edits I made were after my editing privileges were blocked, and then only to correct misinformation in the Farmer article, all of which has since been re-inserted by Wyss herself.  You're right, all I wanted was accuracya simple review of my very first post to Wyss' talk page will show (despite my improper posting etiquette, for which I have repeatedly apologized) that all I asked her to do was fact-check.

I am well aware of the Rashomon like qualities of attempting to discern the truth about Frances Farmer.  That indeed is why the subtitle to my article """"Shedding Light on Shadowland"""" is indeed called The Truth About Frances Farmer.  That in turn is why my research has been used by A&E; Biography, NPR, the Washington Post, and, hilariously, the magazine Wyss apparently thinks discredits me, 'American Atheist.'  If you read Conrad Goeringer's article in 'American Atheist' you will find that I am his major source of information and, indeed, there is a whole secondary article about me and my findings vis a vis the false lobotomy allegations.

What bothers me about all of this is not the block (though Wyss says it's easy to get rescinded, I have yet to receive even a hint of how to do that, but that truly is not important to me), but Wyss' repeated assertions that I have sinister motives and, more importantly, have cloned her ID and/or impersonated her.  In terms of my motives, I have for over 20 years worked diligently to rid the world of misinformation about Frances Farmer, and I have been lauded internationally in the press and broadcast media for my attempts.  How is that sinsister?  In terms of the cloning/impersonation, what more can I say?  I have asked repeatedly for someone to do something technical to prove I didn't do it.

It seems that Wyss has had frequent run-ins with others, and perhaps I am the unwitting recipient of some pent-up frustration on her part.  As I have come to surmise, I am probably at least twice as old as most of you, and I am willing to cut you """"kids"""" (joke) some slack, but I want these false allegations to stop and I am asking again for someone to do an IP trace and consclusively state publicly to Wyss and everyone involved that I had nothing to do with this clone ID/impersonation affair.""",[],0

 Metacompiler 

Hay I see you contributed to compiler-compiler and to the metacompiler page adding a CWIC topic

It seams that the originator of the metacompiler topic intended it to include forth or at least is using the forth idea of a metacompiler saying that because it compiles it's self I.E.

Defining itself and translating itself this way constitutes the meta-step that sets a metacompiler apart from other compiler-compilers

A common saying on FORTH sites. Especially """"meta step"""" The fact is that LISP compiles it's self practically the same identical way as Forth does.

Self-hosting compilers are common. Most general purpose language compilers are self-hosted. I pointed out that many of the compilers I wrote or worked on, compiled themselves. And actually the initial development steps of self hosting compilers are the same as described. I was head of the Language Development Group at Kontron electronics. Many console games were written using our compilers. All of the compilers were written in an extended PASCAL. Which bootstrapped from scratch. Most were cross compilers for processors our In Circuit Emulators supported. Actually I started with FutureData that was bought be GenRad and then sold to Kontron.

A self-hosting metacompiler is a lot easier to bootstrap up then a general purpose language.
 
Historically metacompilers were compiler compilers. Compiler compiler was the general term used in the 60's Then yacc yuked that up being a parser generator. And calling it's self Yet Another Compiler Compiler. Compared to the compiler compilers of 60's yacc is only hacc. Half a compiler compiler. My term was Half Ass Compiler Compiler. There are implementation of yacc that use yacc to compile it's self. So metacompiler (old version) hasn't really separates it's self from other compiler compilers. Sense the start of this despute I have added referanced defination of metacompilers. The [Sci-Tech Dictionary McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Scientific and Technical Terms, 6th edition, published by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. http://www.answers.com/topic/metacompiler] clearly states """" A metacompilers is a compiler that is used chiefly to construct compilers for other programming languages.""""

We have gotten into a flame war on the metacompiler talk page over the defining feature:

""""The feature that sets a metacompiler apart from a standard compiler-compiler is that a metacompiler is written in its own language and translates itself."""" 
Defining itself and translating itself this way constitutes the meta-step that sets a metacompiler apart from other compiler-compilers

It's true that a metacompiler usually defines it's self. But not all metacompiler were self-hosted for various reasons. Damon really went ballistic when I found a metacompiler written in PL/1 in a reference he gave to prove his position. Going on about me misconstruing his I do not know what.

The subjects of compiler-compiler, syntax-directed-compiler, and metacompiler are all closely related. And at one time were the same thing. The distinguishing factors are needed if they are really separate subjects.

There have been many metacompiler over the years that are called metacompilers. Some like BOOK1, BOOK2, and CWIC are meta compilers An early metacompiler that did not call it's self a meta compiler was:

""""A compiler-building system developed by Brooker and Morris"""" Brooker and Morris, Communications of the ACM Volume 7 Issue 7, July 1964 It has a parsing language """"BNF"""" and a machine description language """"MDL"""" There is an intermediate """"GSL"""" generation Strategy L:anguage.

CWIC was based partly on Schorre's META compilers and partly on LISP2 developed at SDC The syntax language includes features from TREE META. Is unclear of Schorre worked on TREE META. Thhe Stanford Research paper does not list Schorre. 

I implemented an extended CWIC compiler compiler on a DEC-System-10 between 1969 and 72. I added a machine description language and created a pseudo operation language (macro like functions using most of the CWIC generator production language). I am very familiar with how CWIC worked. I have taken to using TREE META terminology using unparse rules instead of pattern matching as used in CWIC documentation. The rules are actually recursive EVAL(ADD[EVAL(X),EVAL(Y)])=> has EVAL calling it's self on the tree legs and returning local variables in X and Y. That is a feature of tree meta also except tree meta doesn't have local variables.

I started an RFC and probably did it wrong as there has been no comments other then our bickering.

Val Schorre submitted papers in the SegForth ACM group in the 80s. Val said forth is not a meta compiler on his web site (now gone so can't be referanced).

"No-AfD proposal 
Consider the background to Mtking and Newmanoconnor immediately agreeing to your no-AfD proposal. Just a week ago they wouldn't have even given you the time of day. The current situation has them very scared and they'll pretty much do anything do anything to fast-track their terrible plan through. This is why they're talking 1-2 week timelines whereas before they've been been screwing with the MMA community for months with an incomplete doc while AfD'ing everything in sight. Of course, short-tracking necessarily means they'll railroad the MMA voices against. If they don't get the short-track, their plan is essentially dead, which is why they'll show a tiny bit of leeway in the short term to get what they want in the long term.

"After Bismarck
Looking at the fact, that the period of time the first paragraph talks about is approximately 24 years long, longer than the time Bismarck was in charge, I doubt whether it is said enough about this period. My English is relatively bad, so I won’t do it myself. But here are some important issues:
The militarism the article talks about as implemented by the emperor was a social phenomenon, about which later (Weimar) politicians said, that it was one reason for WW I. Because of this all Germans were guilty for forcing the war and had to accept their responsibility. In the article it looks like the population didn’t support the militarism. It was just the other war around. Bismarck’s policy of a “satuierter Staat” (satisfied Country) was not  strongly supported by the Germans.
Also the sentence “Ein Platz an der Sonne” (a place at the Sun) should be mentioned. It stands for the German demand for colonies.

Also Wilhelm II’s fleet policy should be mentioned. The german fleet was heavily expanded, which made the British Empire look at Germany anxiously. “Politik der freien Hand”)

Also some of Wilhelm II’s unpredictable and foolish acts (for example during the second morocco-crisis (“Panthersprung nach Agadir”) or as he wrote the “Krüger Depesche” to congratulate Paul Kruger for fighting down a riot of British settlers, which was forced by the British government) should be placed here. 

Also a link to the Fashoda-crisis and its solution and the Entente Cordiale or the Triple Entente should be amended, as they were referred as a surrounding of Germany by enemies (“Umringt von Feinden”).

Another matter is, that it is not clear whether Bismarck himself would have been able to keep up his system of treaties for a longer period of time, because of it’s complexity. Some historians believe, that this system had to lead to a new European war, it only was the question, when.
I hope that an English-speaking person will read this and will take him- or herself some time to think of the things I tried to point out.
Indeed it is necessary, as the history part of the Germany article is let’s say … short. They are not even mentioning the Rhine confederation. Mit freundlichem Gruße",[],0

I know allegations of admin abuse require clear proof, but it may be below. See, I wouldn't mind so much if I knew what bad behavior I was doing. I have in good faith begged and pleaded for anyone, anyone with expertise or experience to explain what was blockable; please take the time to review considerately. At virtually every turn, when I requested a policy clarification as a 2-month user, if I even got a cite, it was only to a whole policy page, and never with a diff to my alleged offense. This behavior is so consistent from so many users that it is hard to explain, much less to provide sources for this possibly exceptional claim. But let's please start with what points I do get, and the questions I need answered first by you, the reviewer:
(N.b. I wrote this the first hour of block. I trustingly clicked Save and did not realize that there would be an edit conflict due to the edit warrior (below) closely following me and stating her block agreement """"sadly"""" (huh?) and giving nuanced advice and compliments (unhelpful). This minor frustration can be gotten past, but of course this request is now many hours late. PLEASE at least quickly indicate willingness to answer.)
See whole discussion. As near as I can tell, WP:POINT is intended to refer to my politely proposing a change to WP:V (my first policy suggestion) and disclosing what I regarded as an edit war about the issue. Instead of any comments on the merits (except one positive one), I received consistent criticism about my poor formatting followed by refusal to address the merits because (apparently) it was obviously unnecessary to answer. Q. When one has made a policy suggestion in good faith and one receives zero discussion on its negatives and significant negative discussion on one's person and presentation, is one refusing to get the point if one continues politely requesting the specific demerits of the proposal that would indicate nonconsensus on its merits?
See whole user discussion. As near as I can tell, WP:HAR (first I've heard of this charge against me) is intended to refer to my appropriate-level user warnings in response to an editor using obscenity and assuming bad faith this is only the most reasonable guess, of course. After he stated he was entitled to assume bad faith, he changed up and claimed facetiously he really was assuming good faith. My links there indicate specifically what behavior I referred to. I know of no other case which might come near to harassment. Q. When one uses edit warnings in full compliance with policy and is met with continuing bad faith, is one harassing?
See whole COI discussion. As near as I can tell, WP:DE is intended to refer primarily to my first extended correction of a user charging me with COI, along with a suggestion that the accusing user may also have COI. Certainly I might have been overstrong in that edit (I recognize not noticing the 200-word limit, but I adverted that myself). But again, there was no indication of why a donor to a political candidate has the sort of close relationship envisioned by COI. There was one attempt at googling me (and I'm not looking up the personal details policy right now) which turned up nothing undisclosed besides my blog comments but this was described as """"considerable involvement of ... promotional activities"""". Recall there are about 60,000 Ron Paul Meetup volunteers, and nearly that many donors. If I worked for a 60,000-member workplace there might be a bit more point, but even that would be debatable in good faith. Q. Is every political donor or Meetup member forbidden from editing candidate-related articles neutrally, or only those who willingly disclose the relationship?
As near as I can tell, there is a further potential application of WP:POINT (which by the way is an application of the rule, convenient to the generic, that a generic warning is fungible with any warning). Apparently I don't realize that, in some sense, these users are every one justified in refusing to explain specifically any of their adverse actions against me, and that I am being disruptively pointed if I explain specific charges against them, citing policy and diffs. And there I do admit not understanding. The policies are no Procrustean bed, but very specific. I am completely unfamiliar with operating in such an environment other than to do one's best to WP:AGF, to complain properly and carefully, and to accept potential suffering for it. However I'm essentially barred by generic threats (yes) from complaining specifically, and I'm completely certain that a generic, unsourced complaint from me (as appears to be the",[],0

Original article should be like this

 

Franjo Tuðman (May 14, 1922 - [[December
9]], 1999) was the first president of Croatia in
the 1990s.

Tuðman's political party HDZ (Hrvatska Demokratska
Zajednica, Croatian Democratic Union) won the first
post-communist multi-party elections in 1990 and
he became the president of the country. A year later he
proclaimed the Croatian declaration of independence. He
was reelected twice and remained in power until his death
in late 1999. In English, his surname is spelled
""""Tudjman"""".

The Communist

Franjo Tuðman was born in Veliko Trgovišæe, a village in
the Hrvatsko Zagorje region of northern Croatia.

During WWII Tuðman fought on the side of
Tito's partisans, where he
also met his future wife, Ankica. He became one of the
youngest generals in the Yugoslav People's Army in the
1960s — a fact which some observers linked to the
fact that he sprung from Zagorje, a region that gave few
Communist partisans.

Others have observed that Tuðman was probably the most
educated of Tito's generals (as regards military history,
strategy and the interplay of politics and warfare)
— this claim is supported by the fact that
generations of future Yugoslav generals based their
general exam theses on his voluminous book on guerilla
warfare throughout history: Rat protiv rata (""""War
against war""""), 1957, which covers topics as diverse as
Hannibal's drive across the Alps, the Spanish war
against Napoleon and Yugoslav partisan
warfare.

Tuðman left active army service in 1961 to found the
Institut za historiju radnièkoga pokreta Hrvatske
(""""Institute for the History of Croatia's Workers'
Movement""""), and remained its director until 1967.

The Dissident

Apart from the book on guerilla warfare, Tuðman wrote a
series of articles  attacking the Yugoslav
Communist establishment, and was
subsequently expelled from the Party. His most important
book from that period was Velike ideje i mali narodi
(""""Great ideas and small peoples""""), a monograph on
political history that collided with central dogmas of
Yugoslav Communist elite with regard to the
interconnectedness of the national and social elements in
the Yugoslav revolutionary war (during [[World War
II|WWII]]).

In 1971 he was sentenced to two years of prison for
alleged subversive activities during the so-called
""""Croatian Spring"""".

The Croatian Spring was a reformist movement that was
actually set in motion by Tito and Croatian party
chief Bakariæ in the climate of
growing liberalism in the late 60s. It was initially a
tepid and ideologically controlled party liberalism, but
it soon grew into mass manifestation of dissatisfaction
with the position of the Croatian people in
Yugoslavia, and it began to threaten the party's
political monopoly. The result was a brutal suppression by
Tito, who used the military and the police to crush
what he saw as the threat to his undivided power - Bakariæ
quickly distanced himself from the Croatian Communist
leadership that he himself helped gain power earlier, and
sided with the Yugoslav ruler.

During the turbulent 1971, Tuðman's role was that of the
dissident who questioned the central myth of modern
Serbian nationalism, the number of victims of
the Jasenovac concentration camp, as well as the role
of centralism in Yugoslav and the continuation of
ideology of unitary """"Yugoslavism"""". Tuðman felt that this
originally Croatian romantic pan-Slavic idea from the
19th century had been mutated in harsh realities in both
Yugoslav states into the front for a pan-Serbian drive for
domination over non-Serb peoples — from economy and

it was written in a promotional tone. Articles must be neutral and encyclopaedic.

Known for being able to sing and rapping in pidgin or Yoruba... interest for music became a greater calling he could not ignore... was able to explore his range of musical talent... did not however leave him lacking in his ability to contribute... but it was all good natured fun... working diligently... to give his fans the music they so rightfully deserve...— it's long on mind -reading, opinions and spam, and short of real facts, such as record sales, awards etc.

"Ohhhh! I know what your talking about now, that little dark spot in the photographs. Oh man, this is toooooo funny. Time for a justified rare instance of l33t speak on wikipedia: ROFLMAO!!! 
regain compusure* K, let me explain.
I'll start with the basics: spacecraft are very expensive. They can only send a few out of earth orbit (where they have no ability to generate income like earth sattelite spacecraft) every so often. For various reasons they place the few spacecraft that can be afforded in equatorial orbitsmainly because they can't afford to send out 1 spacecraft for each planet, so they have to keep the sattelite orbiting in the solar plain so it can be sent to another planet later. From equatorial orbits there is only one way to take a picture of the polesfrom the side! Even though the picture looks like it is one shot from the top, it is actually several shots from the side and put together to make it look like its one shot from the top. In order to make it look like its taken from the top, they have to correct for the fact that its actually taken from the side. The very top just becomes a gross stretched out mess.

For example, I'm half-Norwegian and half-Cantonese and I've gotta say... there are between 5-10% Christians in China and it's definitely not around 90% in Norway just because there are that many members in the State church. Will the number of Christians in Norway really fall by about 80% if the State Church is disbanded? Most of them wouldn't even care! It doesn't work that way. The number of Christians in a country are personal adherants to Jesus not whatever the State has got on paper.

John: As you know the lead-in sentence for this article is In mathematics, a bivector is a quantity in geometric algebra that generalizes the idea of a vector. That is, this article in WP is about the bivector in geometric algebra (although it could be redesigned to deal with tensor algebra, I suppose, which topic is presently an afterthought at the end). As such, the section on Vector algebra is a subheading of the main topic, the bivector in geometric algebra. Consequently, the reference to the pseudovector in this subsection should make note of the predominant usage in texts on geometric algebra, namely that the bivector in 3D is the pseudovector, just another example of the (n-1) grade multivector being the pseudovector. No? Do you disagree about the common usage?

On that basis it is not exactly a mis-statement but certainly an easily mis-read statement in the article that says: in geometric algebra axial vectors are usually interpreted as bivectors. In fact, what is usual and less open to misconception is  Ławrynowicz """"Hence in 3D we associate the alternate terms of pseudovector for bivector, and pseudoscalar for the trivector"""".

- Sparks was founder of the park, researcher says,    
- By Dave Rogers, Ottawa Citizen, May 9, 2004, p. A9   
- Mackenzie King is often credited with founding the park, but an ex-journalist says Roderick Percy Sparks was the driving force, Dave Rogers reports.   
- The NCC has hired a pair of Outaouais historians to study the origins of Gatineau Park after it received information that contradicts the popular notion that William Lyon Mackenzie King was the father of the park.   
- The evidence, gathered by Chelsea resident and Senate speechwriter Jean-Paul Murray, suggests Roderick Percy Sparks played a far more influential role than the former prime minister in creating the park.   
- Mr. Sparks dedicated 25 years of his life to the creation of a national park in the Gatineau Hills and for 10 years was chairman of the Federal Woodlands Preservation League, a lobby group that encouraged the first government purchase of Gatineau Park.   
- During the 1930s, Mr. Sparks and other members of the league argued there should be a national park in the Gatineau Hills because the widespread cutting of trees for firewood endangered the area's scenic beauty. The government created Gatineau Park in 1938, but it is not a national park and has no legal protection as a park.   
- Mr. Sparks wrote the master plan for development of the park in 1952. The plan recommended that all private property in the area, including his home, be expropriated. Mr. Sparks' vacant house on Meech Lake Road in the park burned under mysterious circumstances in 2001 two months after Mr. Murray, the former managing editor of the federalist Cite libre magazine began asking questions about its owner.   
- There was no electricity or combustible material, other than the building itself, to create a fire risk, nor was there evidence of fire starting from the nearby woods.   
- No cause for the fire was ever made public. The police did not release a report and the report from the fire authorities was almost a blank. There was no cause, no suspects and no investigation.   
- An obituary on Mr. Sparks in the Ottawa Journal of March 30, 1959 called him the “father of the Gatineau Park,” adding that as chairman of the Federal Woodlands Preservation League, he “brought about the first purchase by the Dominion government of what is now the Gatineau Park.”   
- Born in 1880, where the Supreme Court of Canada stands today, Percy Sparks was the great grandnephew of Ottawa pioneer Nicholas Sparks. He played a leading role in the customs investigation that led to the King-Byng Affair and to the subsequent defeat of the Liberal government. Mr. Sparks' contemporaries generally acknowledged him as the park's founder.   
- “Percy Sparks was a giant who brought down Mackenzie King's government in 1926,” Mr. Murray said. """"He was the man who did more to create Gatineau Park than anybody else from lobbying to writing the first master plans.   
- Mr. Murray said Mr. King was cautious about the creation of the park. “I found an interesting passage in his diary from 1937, a few months before the park was created, that showed he wasn't enthusiastic about the park because people might think he was trying to improve his property.”   
- “The NCC says that he was one of the major architects of the park, but this disproves it.”   
- Mr. Murray said the NCC never mentioned Mr. Sparks' role in creating the park so people wouldn't be tempted to advocate it",[],0

Echoing the statement above, with some more elucidation: there is no objective criteria under which the Telegraph is a more objective (or """"reputable"""") source than Counterpunch. The Telegraph was a part of the Hollinger International chain of newspapers, whose board of directors happened to include one Richard Perle  a known American conservative and supporter of the Israeli right-wing. The Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs is likewise a think tank and reliquary for Israeli right-wingers (retired military and diplomatic staff especially) and funded by convicted felon Michael Milken. It is not hard to see that a right-wing ideologue Weiner did a hit-piece on Edward Said using funds from a right-wing think tank, published it in a right wing journal (Commentary), that was picked up by a sympathetic newspaper (the Daily Telegraph).

Presenting either the Jerusalem Center or the Telegraph as """"objective"""" is an obvious distortion, that only owes itself to the right-wing media having warped the meaning of """"objective"""" and """"fair and balanced"""".

As you will see these messages will flag either on your email and/or at the top of the page next time you log in. Editor to editor messages not about a specific page are usually done this way.

To answer you question. I put ticks to show how we can join the dots but can only do it through reliable sources if you are not sure is something is a reliable source you can always ask at WP:RSN (reliable sources noticeboard).

Perhaps an example of what you can do with your sources is the easiest way to go. In my sandboxes|sanbox]] I am many others developing an article on  one of the players in that was a man called Francis Windebank (Royalist soldier) as Wikpedia had no article on him, I created one based on the text in the Dictionary of National Biography for his father  see Wikisource:Windebank, Francis (DNB00). To do this I had to extract the article from an OCR version that is kept on Wikisource and put place it where it is now. So having put in the work to extract the article about his father I added said information to his more famous father's article Francis Windebank  With me so far? (BTW. We can copy copyright expired text strait into an article. The dos and don't are explained in the guideline WP:PLAGIARISM).
 
So when I expanded the Francis Windebank article it included the line """"Two others (daughters) became nuns of the Calvary at the Marais du Temple, Paris"""". Marais du Temple was a red-link, so I went on line and discovered that there was little in English on it but there was a French Wikipedia article so I copied and translated the lead from the French article and created Temple du Marais as a stub, unfortunately it still does not have citations, but from the pictures it clearly exists so it has not been put up for deletion. But in creating that article another red link was created Michel Villedo. So I created a stub for that. In that case it was much easier to source because there are reliable English language sources for the man.

So as you can see, one can use an article like minor campaigns of 1815 which has the potential to spark a whole level of creativity with missing biographies. It was your edit to the article that prompted me to look up detail on Charles Auguste Creutzer, and as I found enough I created the stub Charles Auguste Creutzer. But that still leave open the question """"how do you know that Siborne was referring to Charles Auguste Creutzer when he wrote General Kreutzer and not some other General Kreutzer? What is your source for saying he was the commandant of the Fortress of Bitsch?"""". As soon as a source can be found that say that we can modify the text or create an redirect

Perhaps we should work on that section here.  Here's the text, which I've started making an effort to clean up... although it needs a lot more work.
Oh, and the page should probably be all Harvard refs, rather than none:  Wikipedia usually sticks with the style chosen by the first author.    

Instrumental rudeness and pragmatic competence
Sometimes, people deliberately employ rude behaviors to achieve a goal.  Early works in linguistic pragmatism interpreted rudeness as a defective mode of communication.  However, most rudeness serves functional or instrumental purposes in communication, and skillfully choosing when and how to be rude may indicate a person's pragmatic competence.  

Prior to the mid-1990s, most linguistics research ignored the instrumental or 'useful' nature of rudeness in speech (Brown & Levinson, 1987; Grice, 1975; Lakoff, 1973).  Before then, rudeness was seen as a sign of communication failure:  Lakoff gave """"two rules"""" of pragmatic competence (1973): be clear, and be polite. Grice (1975) believed that rudeness violated universal norms of conversation of truthfulness, politeness and relevancy.  Likewise,  Brown and Levinson's politeness framework (1987  pp. 60-61) is also based on the idea that politeness is normative and rudeness is eschewed even when engaging in 'face-threatening acts' (FTAs) such as making a complaints or refusing a request.  """"The semantics and pragmatics of utterances must be taken into account in assessing degree of face redress; if the overt content of an utterance is rude, for example, politeness strategies won’t necessarily redeem it."""" (Brown & Levinson, 1987, p. 22)

Robin Lakoff (1989) addressed what she named 'strategic rudeness,' a style of communication used by prosecutors and therapists to force their interlocutors (a courtroom defendant or patient) to talk or react in a certain way.  

Gabriele Kasper (1990) gives us the earliest definition of rudeness in an academic paper.   In her discussion of Lakoff's (1989) research on strategic rudeness, Kasper (1990) defines rudeness as speech that is """"constituted by deviation from whatever counts as politic in a given social context, is inherently confrontational and disruptive to social equilibrium"""" (Kasper, 1990, p. 208).  This definition is important, in that it marks rudeness as speech which is confrontational at its core.  Although Kasper (1990) further defines rudeness as 'motivated' and 'unmotivated,' her definitions do not make use of natural data.  

It is not until Leslie Beebe's research comes along in the early to mid-1990s that data on naturally occurring instances of rudeness in everyday conversation is collected.  Drawing from Lakoff's (1989) idea of strategic rudeness, Beebe (1993a, 1993b, 1994, 1995) similarly proposes the concept of instrumental rudeness; rudeness that is meant to achieve a goal.  Like Lakoff (1989) and Kasper (1990), Beebe (1995) believes that rudeness is confrontational behaviour, and indeed in her research, she found that """"hostility seemed to pervade the data"""" (Beebe, 1995, p. 156).   In her study of naturally occurring rudeness in New York City, Beebe (1995) provides her own definition of rudeness:

""""In this study, rudeness is defined as a face threatening act (FTA)- or feature of an FTA such as intonation- which violates a socially sanctioned norm of interaction for the social context in which it occurs.  It is only rudeness if it receives insufficient redressive action to mitigate its force or, of course, if it does not occur in a context, such as intimacy or emergency, that would negate the need for redressive action.  Consequently, it causes antagonism, discomfort, or conflict and results in some disruption to the social harmony.   The idea that socially sanctioned norms of interaction are violated is central to the perception of rudeness."""" (Beebe, 1995, p. 159)

In this definition, Beebe (1995) asserts that rudeness is an FTA, or a feature of an FTA, that has not been mitigated by redressive action and does not occur between intimates or in emergency situations.  Essentially, rudeness is a bald, on-record face attack, and not a failed attempt at politeness.  This definition would also most likely preclude culturally-specific ritual insults, verbal games, or manners of speech that are used among members of certain social groups.   Labov (1972) argues that ritual insults, or 'sounding,' follow certain linguistic, organizational, and interactional rules.   If such speech among members of a cultural in-group could be seen as following 'socially sanctioned norms of interaction' (as Labov, 1972, argues) where there is a low risk of face-loss, it would most likely not be considered 'rude speech,' according to Beebe's (1995) definition of rudeness.

So the hot debate is not so much a partisan debate along """"party lines"""" (note you will not be able to see such lines ona cloudy day, so don't bother to look for them), as it is along the lines of which elected or appointed officials are willing to come out of the closet as kept mistresses, and openly do the bidding of their masters. It's a true nail-biter. The """"debate"""" has been keeping """"voters"""" on the edge of their seats for years, even though numerous laws have been passed that could count as tort reform, if the counters were honest. For example, the 1995 Securities Litigation Reform Act, and numerous court decisisons (there's one in front of the Supremem Court nowwonder if the little guy will win?) which limits the ability of defrauded mom and pop investors in teh stock market to sue fraudulent companiesmany of which are operating under the guise of a Fortune 500 firm, as Enron did.

As new peoples were encountered, fought, and ultimately subdued, theories about """"race"""" began to develop, and these helped many to justify the differences in position and treatment of people whom they categorized as belonging to different races (see Eric Wolf's Europe and the People Without History).

On the account of hello5678, when I edited to write the truth, since I work with the media and knew the actual truth, you did what you knew best - to block accounts and even have the foolish audacity to write that it did not seem I was a journalist. Your block anyways went futile ( like all your remaining blocks on other users go, and future blocks will be going ) since as I had said, there are a million computers to comment and reply from. It just depends on my wish if I want to respond to idle losers like you and whether I have the time to do so. Once and for all, I am doing it this time, and won't remove time for worthless people like you again.

You had some advice on how I should spend my """"blocked time"""" by reading WP:Dispute pages on Wikipedia so that I have better ideas on dealing with disputes. Actually ,you need better ideas to deal with life. I am not foolish like you to spend any amount of my time bothering about rubbish written by stupid people like you who have no work in real life and spend days editing pages on Wikipedia/ Scribblebook that no one bothers to read. Some people are just unfortunate like you and 2over0. And if you are troubled by my calling that actress """"sleazy"""", then that's your problem. Cos that's the only work she has done and the press uses precisely that term while referencing her work. You also spoke about writing """"accurate"""" information on wikipedia. Ironic, when you don't even bother finding out what is accurate, and spend endless hours blocking, and acting admin as if it is an important position in yourCarry on with your scribble game. And if you feel threatened by media exposure, then that shows you knew you were wrong. It's only when people are wrong that they feel threatened. Pity your personality. Also, you ended by writing that """" it's clear you aren't a journalist, and have no means of carrying out your threat """" - LOL. Sad, that you lived in that illusion. For JOKERS like you who are totally idle,and who scribble away in virtual  life. Oh wait, that may be the only position you probably have or will have ever in your unfortunate life.

Carry on with your scribble game. And if you feel threatened by media exposure, then that shows you knew you were wrong. It's only when people are wrong that they feel threatened. Pity your personality. Also, you ended by writing that """" it's clear you aren't a journalist, and have no means of carrying out your threat """" - LOL. Sad, that you lived in that illusion. For JOKERS like you who are totally idle,and who scribble away in virtual pages on Wiki-scribble-pedia, will obviously withdraw from the truth. You yourself have no idea at all if I am a journalist, and you write that it's clear that I am not. Well, you are also inane and a clown to fool yourself. I had all means, and the said article has already been published. I had NO TIME to let you know, since I am a busy person, unlike you and do not find time to come scribble on virtual pages that clowns like you , 2OVERO, 2/0, AKERANS, MANAGERARC, FISHERQUEEN (yeah, we named you again - Suck it up),  KURU etc. do all your life. You will find that information, depending on which Godforsaken part of the world you live in.  And like last time, you can go ahead and block me this time too. For , no one cares two hoots for your silly blocking games. We do have a life, unlike losers like you. Maybe its time for you to go fish in real life, so that you can come anywhere remotely close to having a life - LOL.
SO, LOSERQUEEN, GROW UP and GET A LIFE, You IDLE CLOWN OR ELSE, YOU WILL REMAIN A LOSER ALL YOUR LIFE. WHO CARES ANYWAY WHAT INANE, PUERILE LOSERS LIKE YOU DO IN THEIR LIVES. Cos all you know best is to play edit and block games on your scribblebook called wikipedia. Scribble on cos anyway no one cares and I most certainly don't. Time for you to go fishing then, LOSERQUEEN. And I wont bother to check any replies or anything else ever, cos I dont have time unlike Idle LOSERS like you, Loserqueen. You are no where near a queen, but certainly are a huge ,filled with trash, dustbin. Pity you, unfortunate daft-LOSER- DUSTBIN.

This isn't funny asshole! Guess what? I have been using another account and you don't even know what it is since the very first time I was blocked! Ha, keep playing your games, you aren't preventing me from editing piece of shit. Oh and  don't think I forgot about your 5 year old temper issues when anyone tries and fixes issues with your precious Dreamcast punk ass bitch. Lol, you guys did a number on this account. Probably found out what program I was using for the first BS account you made. 

I am impressed with how much damage you have done to this account, but it really means nothing when I am still editing every day on my personal internet and you have no idea which account it is. Oh and no it's not using a proxy or a public wifi spot. Heck, I may even try reporting this, all you idiots did was use proxy's, if I post on this account on my personal connection, and THEN appeal this I might just get my account back and get you idiots banned. I know exactly what you are going to do after this to wait until I log off, and then pounce with a new account. Sadly, looking at all this crap in my talk page, an admin would have to be retarded to not see how many of these """"accounts"""" that are proxies and not actual connections. You can only hide the smell of rotten fish for awhile before someone notices.

Shit, may was well clean this shit up. 

Oh wait a second one more thing, , what kind of retarded admin are you when having a bunch of almost all accounts pretending to be me are all on proxies and not ONE of them acts like me (did you even see my history?), and not one uses a real connection? Got that brain damage you do. had to put that in bold to be clear. Warning me about an indefinite block, lol, what does that matter, you already screwed up noticing what a 5 year old would have noticed by now. Any person would be frustrated by the silliness of this nonsense. I would appeal but something tells me to much shit damage and retarded admins will make this impossible, and I would rather not use the IP of my other account (using a real connection n my personal internet) because then you guys will probably be jackass and deleted for fun, look at this page! All this shit and nothing clicked in your small head? Amazing wikipedia. 

Also I need to take note to stay away from low ranked video game pages and focus on popular until you guys get tired of the act.

Also I KNOW you guys got an account that is going to post a bit after I submit this post I SAW him and he did the EXACT same thing 3 of the duded did, you guys need help, I can't believe not one guy was not like """"this shit don't make sense"""" for a whole second. Amazing.

Alright, so clean this page and leave this message here. Erase other extra crap. Alright, looks like we are in business. BTW, I know this is probably bull, but if any of you two actually are not trolling, which is highly unlikely, than post request an admin to come by so I can clear this account up. But I have this sinking feeling you guys all knew what's been going on here this whole time, and I have no patience to search through tons of pages to find ONE contact I can talk to about this block, so you might have this account, but you won't get the other one. Suck doesn't it? Until then, I will be going about my day and you guys will most likely probably still be doing this for X amount of days cause I guess you think it's funny? Yeah.

One is a shit admin that posted a warning on this page. Two I had to deal with multiple times, and it seems they got something against me because they are making accounts trying to make admins believe they are me, yet they act more like them, even their edit summaries are just like theirs. If there are any sane admins left drop me a message so we can have a private conversation and I can prove things to open this account back up.

We can get away with it, by continuing to use our power to censor free thinkers like Mardyks and his kind. Sony Pictures is paying us all off with tickets, so let us know how many you want. FREE popcorn, too! Whoopee! Best wishes from Jimini Cricket 97.123.26.228

You have been blocked from editing for a period of 31 hours for your disruption caused by edit warring and violation of the three-revert rule at The Amazing Race 21. During a dispute, you should first try to discuss controversial changes and seek consensus. If that proves unsuccessful you are encouraged to seek dispute resolution, and in some cases it may be appropriate to request page protection.

I love how two editors can gang up on a third, including being so nasty that one of them draws a block for incivility, and it's me who ends up getting fucked by their bad faith actions. Excellent evidence for the proposition that when you give anyone a little power they'll abuse it. Great decision. Spot fucking on. Buck Winston (talk) 
[edit]Hmm

(Non-administrator observation) I've only taken a cursory look at the article, but it looks like you made a good point - I can only think of a handful of shows to have featured three gay characters in a season, and I'd agree with you that it should definitely be put in that category. Regardless, if you plan on making more edits like this and this, you might find yourself with a block extension. Bbb23's a good administrator, and 3RR's called """"bright-line rule"""" for a reason. And considering that edit-warring blocks are to get users to cool down, if this is how you responded, it looks like he made the right call. — Francophonie&Androphilie;(Je vous invite à me parler)

(3) As Gwen Gale's official man servant, would you create articles about yourself and your terrible novel just like your master did?

I understand I am a bit late in this discussion and it has probably already concluded and everyone is probably already over it but I have to say the following; American English is quite simply English for the stupid man (and of course your country would require it.) Your version of English is over-simplified. 
I am sick of Americans always thinking that their way is the only way. Why shouldn't you accept our spelling?
 Webster was incorrect in his changing of the English language. If I was to start spelling things incorrectly would that mean that it is a new way of spelling and I would be a reformist rather than an idiot? I think not. 09:04, 17",['malignant'],1

 While I respect the fact that you've obviously given this some thought, a few counterpoints: 1) Every single state in the union, with the possible exception of Rhode Island (mostly because it's so damn tiny), is a """"transitional"""" state with the features you mentioned. Examples: California includes ghettos, really rich gated comunities, hick towns (such as Watsonville, or virtually any city more than 100 miles from the coast), and the Bay Area. New York? Same deal, if you've ever been to upstate New York you'll see. And of course, the reverse is true too - a lot of Texas is really nice, progressive even. I've heard some less-than-terrible things about Birmingham, Alabama. Even Okla-dumbass-homa has some okay parts of Tulsa. So I honestly believe that you're about 180 degrees on this one - your statement, while eloquent, was somewhat meaningless, whereas History makes some valid points (the most valid of which is that if you (speaking in the generic, non-threatening second person) call me a """"southerner"""", I will tie you to the back of a pickup truck and drag you to your death while throwing beer cans out the window to hit you in your skull.

 Hypocrisy 

I'm sick of this clique mentality. Rodhullandemu told me my proposed contribution to an article was worth """"fuck all"""".

My contribution which, apparently, was worth """"fuck all"""" and was """"piss poor"""" is currently featured in the article.

Doubtless these inconvenient facts will do little to change your mind regarding my block. But at least show a little consistency with regards to personal attacks and use of profanities.

The Arabs were the ones who illegally colonized and continue to illegally occupy Israel. Nableezy is also an anti-Semite.

"""==BLACK SLANG==
This article suggests that using """"bitch"""" to describe a young woman is exclusive to hip hop culture. This is not the case. This is THE prominent term to describe a woman in the African-American community. How many black people do you know who actually call a woman a woman? None. They all say """"bitch"""" as in """"Ah fucked dis bitch las' naht nigga. She wa' FAAAHN."""" Black people will NEVER say """"woman"""" because it is ingrained in their culture to be derogatory towards women! THAT is why it is used in hip hop, because that is black entertainment. Misogyny is a crucial element of African0American culture and this is why black people throw around the word """"bitch"""" as a synonym for """"woman"""".

 UNBLOCK ME YOU ASSHOES! 

{{unblock|HAHAHAHA!!!

One of my favorite and most vivid memories was of a party I attended in high school. It was near the end of the year, and everyone was letting loose. The party had not gotten too badly out of control, and was finally winding down.

I was dating Karen at the time. We'd been going out for about six months. We knew our time together was growing short since we'd soon be heading off to college, she to Radcliffe, and I to Johns Hopkins. We were taking every chance we could to be intimate. I'd been with a few girls before, but Karen had been my first long term intimate relationship, and we'd taught each other lots.

The party was at Keith's house and we were helping him clean up. There were only six of us left, Karen and I, Keith, his girlfriend Linda, Tom and his girlfriend Sue. Linda lived just a few doors down and had invited Karen and Sue to spend the night. Tom was going to spend the night at Keith's house. Conveniently, Linda's parents were out of town until tomorrow noon, so nobody really had anywhere they had to go, and once we'd done a fair job of cleaning up we are able to sit back and relax.

Keith was my best friend. We had a lot in common, even if we were a bit of a """"Mutt and Jeff"""" in appearance. Both of us tall, I had a wide body, result of my Hawaiian ancestry, while he was lean and blonde. I'm 6'1"""" but he had a good 2 inches on me, and had long hair past his shoulders. Mine is brown and curly, and usually just goes whereever it wants. I'm strong as an ox, he's lean and fast. But we had similar taste in women. On more than one occasion I teased him that there was no way he deserved to be with Linda, our high-school goddess, and he was extremely envious that I had Karen, our big-breasted sexy bombshell, as my partner.

Karen and Sue were close friends. If we'd had Diana here, the triumvirate would have been complete. They had all been innocents until that year. Diana was dating, and Karen told me that she and Ryan were 'almost there', doing everything except the final act. Karen hadn't done much of anything until we'd gotten together. But we didn't let grass grow under us, and we made up for a lot of lost time. We'd had sex plenty, and she'd sucked me off more times than I can count. I'd even fucked her incredible tits a couple of times. Sue, it turns out, was the late bloomer. She was still an innocent according to Karen. Kissing was as far as she'd gone, although it seems she'd rubbed Tom's dick through his pants, and he'd had his hands on her mound, even if the underwear was still in the way. But Karen was hinting that this party might be Tom's lucky night.

We were joking about some of the antics that had been going on at the party. Linda in particular was a lurker; she'd sit back and watch all the activities at the party and was always good for a few laughs.

""""There were some really desperate people here tonight,"""" she said. """"Can you believe Gary tried to get a game of Spin the Bottle going?""""

""""I can't say I really blame him,"""" I answered with a grin. """"Not every guy there is as fortunate as us to have such gorgeous girlfriends, or any girlfriend for that matter. Hell, I wouldn'd mind playing it now!"""" That earned me a poke in the ribs from Karen.

Sue chimed in, """"Why is it that every party ends up with some lame guy trying to start some stupid game like Spin the Bottle, Post Office, or Strip Poker?""""

""""Now that's a stupid question,"""" Keith answered.

""""And why is that?"""" Linda asked, pointedly.

""""Isn't it obvious?"""" Keith replied.

""""No."""" Linda and Sue answered in unison.

""""Do you want to tell them?"""" Keith asked me with a nod.

So I explained the obvious. """"Because they ARE desperate - and sometimes it works.""""

""""Oh please!"""" Karen said.

Keith was a real instigator. """"You guys have never played Spin the Bottle?""""

The girls looked at each other. """"Maybe a few times, but certainly not in the last year."""" Linda finally answered.

""""And how about Truth or Dare?"""" Keith continued egging them on.

""""Well sure, but usually only with people we know really well,"""" Karen answered this time.

""""Usually."""" Keith echoed with a grin. """"And it's not like you've never played Strip Poker.""""

The girls looked at each other quietly no one answering.

""""Oh come on,"""" I teased, """"Karen I know you've played Strip Poker.""""

""""Not really. I watched part of a game, but then they chased everyone not playing out of the room. Why? I suppose you've played it?"""" She asked with a dangerous tone in her voice.

""""Sort of. In camp we started a game but it got raided before we got anywhere."""" I confessed, drawing a laugh from the guys. """"L","['malignant', 'rude', 'abuse']",1

If the idiots weren't constantly vandalizing articles, removing factual information on a whim, none of this would be taking place. As I said elsewhere, wikipedia has gotten a very bad reputation so just such whimsical reverting as the two idiots were constantly doing. 

And going by the things I've read about all of you, no doubt you'll now block me from posting even on my own page.

It seem sto me that th eoriginal noble aims of the founders have gone adrift due to the smallminded pettyness of many contributors.

They usually manifest this smallminded ignorance by deleting any correction to their original articles as seemingly their godliness means the are the supreme authority on most topics even if as is the frequent case they live in some little place in USA ad have no real knowledge of life beyond the stripmalls.   

Constant ingestion of burgers and fries makes them feel to be experts on all things even those of which they know nothing and have n personal experience of.

The fact is that those who explain or justify the hatred of Jews are crackpots and Antisemites. My position is simple: Jewish Bolshivism has only an antisemitic meaning, interpretation, usage, justification, etc. I am not responsible for the fact that that Draius/red (whatever his difficult to remember name is) user deduced that I have insulted him. The insult was his own deduction. I did not hurl at him any insult. And that term popsucker is just my paraphrase of the other dofficult Wiki word for a Wikipedia who disguises his identity. I am not allowed to name any of the people I suspect - what's that word, I don't know, and I do not wish to waste my time looking for it - it sounds something like suckpoper - can you help me out on this? Also, I can no longer locate the Wikipedia linked expression Don't be a dick. Can you please provide me with the link to it. Also, it would be helpful if you located that link to that """"popsucker"""" term. It was user:Noetica  who suspected a pop-x to be disguising himself as such. And

The Assyrians speak modern Aramaic the Aramaic in which Christ spoke 2 thousand years ago you uneducated mule. Your statements lack depth in all facets; they are unencylcopediatic, unsourced, close minded, uneducated, mentally degenerate comments that seek to downsize the most ancient people down to nothing. You claim that this name was invented by some new comers almost a hundred years ago, this comment alone shows how completely incompetent you are. I have documents that are hundreds of years old that have been passed down through my family over the centuries that specifically speak about the Assyrians and how this name is far more ancient then simple minded people like you claim. This will be the only comment I will make for you because I will not waste my time speaking to a mentally degenerate pig such as yourself who is a denialist, racist, and complete bigot and a distorter of history who denies the race of the Assyrians exist.

""""general discussion"""" or """"chatting"""" or a """"point of view"""".  It is a technically
precise set of rules, and in this case, a set of rules that demonstrate that
the foundation of the issue is a fraud.  THIS IS NOT OPINION, IT IS FACT, IT
IS RELEVANT TO THE ARTICLE, IT IS FOUNDATIONAL TO THE ARTICLE.  I AM TALKING
ABOUT IMPROVING THE ARTICLE BY CLARIFYING THE FOUNDATION ACCORDING TO THE
RULES OF ENGLISH GRAMMAR AS ANY LITERATE PERSON CAN SEE.  AND I AM TALKING
ABOUT ADDING THE RELEVANT AND FOUNDATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL CLAUSE.

FROM TALK GUIDELINES (why don't you review them!):

 There is reasonable allowance for speculation, suggestion, and personal
knowledge on talk pages, with a view to prompting further investigation.

 make the extra effort so that other people understand you. Being
friendly is a great help.

 It is always a good idea to explain your views; it is less helpful for you to
voice an opinion on something and not explain why you hold it.

 Article talk pages should be used to discuss ways to improve an article;

 Deal with facts

 The talk page can be used to """"park"""" material removed from the article due to
verification or other concerns, while references are sought or concerns
discussed.

 The talk page is particularly useful to talk about edits.

 New proposals for the article can be put forward for discussion
by other editors if you wish.

 Do not threaten people: For example, ...
having them banned for disagreeing with you.

 removing others' comments is sometimes allowed.
But you should ... stop if there is any objection.

As I previously posted here: THE ARTICLE SHOULD BE IMPROVED by making it clear
in the opening statement that the entire issue is a fraud upon the public
since there is no """"natural born citizen"""" requirement that is applicable today.
That is fundamental to an informative relevant foundation to the article, not
a matter of opinion, and a matter of grammatical fact.

If I say """"No animal except a mouse, or a rat, at the time I give the signal,
shall be captured"""", then I am saying only mice and rats shall be captured AT
THE TIME I GIVE THE SIGNAL.  My order has no validity at any other point in
time.  Similarly, the requirement for """"natural born citizen"""" only applied AT
THE TIME OF THE ADOPTION OF THIS CONSTITUTION.  It does not apply today, and
the following clause should be part of the article, since it is the clause at
the foundation of the issue in the article:

No person except a natural born Citizen, or a
Citizen of the United States, at the time of the
Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible
to the Office of President; neither shall any
person be eligible to that Office who shall not
have attained to the Age of thirty five Years, and
been fourteen Years a Resident within the United
States.

What more information needs to be added?

References, for one. Two college newspaper citations and two MySpaces doesn't cut it. I tried to look for some myself, but google yielded very few related hits. More than ten minutes of recorded output, for another. A label. Right now, the whole thing smacks of blatant self-promotion, and that isn't what Wikipedia is for.  

is there a way i can get that page(s) back so i can save it and re-enter it when they have more references?

Any admin should be able do that for you, I think.

Bill,

I don't find your un-edits a gender-based attack.  I am largely concerned with the content of the article itself, but I wonder why you put up so much opposition to my very small edit.  Surely it can't mean that much to you.

I don't want to make derogatory comments about men.  I have nothing against men, and I don't enjoy tearing people down.  You mention the term """"well-referenced"""".  I prefer for statements to be well-referenced too.  I don't think that this particular statment is well-referenced, and furthermore, I don't think that it can be well-referenced, because I don't think that it is true.  And so I wonder about the author's neutrality.  Wikipedia articles are supposed to be both neutral and well-edited, and that statement is neither.

I don't want the article to be deleted either.  I think that it serves a useful purpose, and I enjoyed reading it.  I just want to do away with that particular sentence.

Of course, if you can find evidence that American women are materialistic sluts, then we have no problem at all.  But I'm pretty sure that whoever wrote that was confusing personal opinion for universal truth.

YOU'RE CONTRADICTING YOURSELF! Basically your opinion of based on blindness and bullshit as far the """"evidence"""" you send me are considered.

Really? Puny pictures in which you can almost not see what her eye color is. You need a magnifying glass to see her eyes. Don't show such pictures cuz it just looks really sloppy and desperate, which in your case makes sense. 1(By magnifying this image up to 400%, you can clearly see her eye color looks sort of olive green, not anywhere close to brown). 2(What the f*** is this? It look horrendous. Oh and her eyes are lighter than her hair and you keep saying they're the same shade, when clearly they're not. Lets take a look at a better quality image. No brown eyes here.)

3(These eyes can still be called hazel.) 4(Hazel eyes due to their nature have the tendency to look goldish brown in certain lights, and look at Belle's hair it looks red). 5(I can clearly see her eyes are not the same as her hair, in fact take a close look when a lock of hair falls in front of her right eyes and clashes with her eyes color. The difference looks brown and hazel, instead of brown and light brown.) 6(That's not a screenshot, and by magnifying the image, her eyes look dark hazel and so not the same color as her hair) 7(400% zoom in, hazel eyes) 8(What a desperate image, you can barely see anything, 1000% zoom in and her eyes appear not to be brown again). 9(400% zoom in, hazel eyes... again)

Oh yes, the Belle merchandise that has her with brown eyes is so big, only one of the pictures you send can sort of qualify. 10 (By magnifying the image up to 400%, you can clearly see her eyes look green-like). 11(400% zoom in, hazel eyes AGAIN)

JESUS F***ING CHRIST. You preseted me with like 18 images and almost all of them have Belle with hazel eyes instead of brown. ARE YOU COLORBLIND? Don't you know how to differentiate colors. An you call this SOLID? If Belle's eyes are hazel, than those are indeed solid, verified evidence. And the screenshots aren't even from the Diamond Edition, they're from the Special Edition.

Take a look at these pics, please. Think anyone will believe you that her eyes are brown? I don't think so. These are just a couple of additions to the pictures you presented, further cementing that Belle has hazel eyes instead of brown. Since hazel is a mix of brown and green and that hazel eyes vary between almost green to almost brown, on what bases are people suppose to believe Belle's eyes are brown?

I really dont think this is asking that much. In terms of diffusing the situation...I tried to add in a passage that all parties could agree to.

Cash I am a walmart assocate and I do feel there is a link between Walmart managment and servant leadership, and here is why. The managers are not in charge of the store, the hourly associates are, they take orders directly from the customers. The customers are consitered under walmarts policies to be the boss, the hourly assocates are next in that order and so on. This is a backwards model that was set fourth by Sam Walton himself and is maintained by the current board. Grassroots survays are conducted every 3mos to a year, this survey is a rating of each manager, and is then reviewed by the district and Regional VP, then changes are made. Each level of management must answer to the hourly assocates, and so it is kinda a push/pull managment system. Take my own situation for an example. heres what happend, one night I am short of assocates in the deli(which is where I work) Temp logs did not get done, of course this is a major mistake, I was """"written up"""" for this. However I did not feel this was fair, so I wrote an email to our district manager explaining the situation, he then forwarded the matter to our regional VP. Our VP came to our store, flew in from bentonville mind you. To deal with the situation, he met with me for about an hour and also met with some other deli assocates. After a week he calls me and tells me that he can not get rid of the Written warning, however that all of the managers that had been informed that we where short, would be on probation for the next six months. I was satisfied with the outcome Because, While I was not fault free in the situation, management however was informed that I did not have enough people to help customers and deal with the food safty logs, and they failed to act accordingly and I was not happy with it, so in the end I punished them for their poor perfomance. So you can kinda see why they consiter it a servant leadership. 

Also Cash I hate the way you term 'vast left-wing conspiracy' I am myself a liberal and we liberals are not part of that conspiracy ideal, that would be your union leaders and right-wing large business owners, that are anti-walmart, As much as you would like to identify us liberals with the unions we are in no way assocated with them, infact most of us liberals dislike the unions just as much if not more then you right-wingers. Because the general public tends to identify unions with the democratic party and this is because most union voters, vote on the liberal side, this does not mean that they are liberals, just that they play the politics game. True liberals hate the unions and feel that they are just as bad or worse then a currupt big business. With a currupt big business atleast you know what they are and they make no bones about it, with a union they want to be your friend and then screw you. lol.

On the part about this entry being POV it is very much so POV however I have given up tring to balance it out myself the Anti-Walmart people always revert your edit and then threaten to get you banned for the three revert rule when you attempt to make any edits, its a freaking joke the way they act. However I have just taken on the Idea that they will destroy the entry to the point where people look at it and just shake their heads and how full of BS it is.""",['rude'],1

On further investigation, the 1st Lord seems to have got me blocked by crying to admins, which seems apt, seeing as he's probably just a child himself. Presumably the use of the phrase """"Bishonen with her finger on the trigger"""" over there waa meant to be funny, but given the context of my complaint, it's just rather tragic. Still, back to the real world, where the Trayvon Martin case is actually real news, and the issues it involves are of encyclopedic value. I've found the articles myself without the help of the front page, but apparently anyone else looking for them can just go to hell (in a bucket?). All, you Lords, Hell Buckets and Rambling men get back to whatever the fuck it is you do around here, which is cleearly not creating a useful encyclopedia (at least you don't seem to be getting in the way of the people who actually managed to write the articles on the shooting and trial, so thank fuck for that).""",['malignant'],1

"Yes, there should be criticism of Schengen.  For Americans and Canadians who want to come and teach English in Schengen countries, the Schengen Agreement is a disaster.  Where before Schengen you could renew your visitor visa by simply leaving and re-entering the country you were teaching in, now you must apply for a work permit, which is a costly and difficult process for Americans and Canadians.  Now, because of Schengen, Americans and Canadians are no longer welcome in Europe to teach English. I have heard of many well intentioned ESL teachers who were travelling between, say Germany and Czech Republic and did not have the proper 'poste Schengen' visa documentation: they were arrested by the police and forcibly stuck on a plane back to America.  No sympathy for their situation, no regard for all their belongings in their flat in Prague, no concern whatsoever: they were treated like criminals breaking the law.  This is the ugly side of Schengen: it is used to keep North Americans from teaching English Europe.  The good old days are gone, replaced with aggressive border police who are looking for ESL teachers to arrest and deport.  Many English schools in Prague, for example, are complaining bitterly against Schengen, because the companies they teach English at want Americannot BritishEnglish teachers.  Further: if you are staying over 30 days on vacation in Europe you will be treated like a criminal because of Schengen: you only get 30 days to visit Europe...then you must GET OUT: or, you must get a travel visa for every single European country you are visiting.  So, for Europeans Schengen may be nice, but for foreigners it is HORRIBLE.  I hate Schengen, and I hate the EU government in Brussels.  What a bunch of fucking assholes!!! They seem to be trying to copy George BUsh with the creation of Schengen. Fuck you EU government dickheads, we ESL teachers all hate you!!!!!!!  You ruined our jobs, our profession.

 You're a liar! You have been lying all along including today, and right here above! Gurubrahma, please see the following examples of lies from just today, and here I'll quote what I wrote to him earlier: 

 Kindly please stop lying if you wish me to stop pointing out your lies. It's very rude and disrespectful when I spend my time citing verifiable and reliable sources and you just lie outright, nevermind content, but even on just simply what's happening here, and here's an example of just how you just now did it before requesting that I stop calling you """"liars""""; from Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#December_8, I quote your statement and my reply to it:

 QUOTED: """"I hope that now since all editors have reached a consensus on the article, and have tried to explain you in clearest possible words the difference between numeral symbols and numeral system, you would play a more constructive role. Thanks.   

 QUOTED: Why are you lying again here? yes, lying! As you had been doing for quite some time now and as I have pointed out. The dictionary defines a lie as """"1. A false statement deliberately presented as being true; a falsehood. 2. Something meant to deceive or give a wrong impression."""" First of all, """"all editors have reached a consensus on the article"""" is a demonstrable false statement that you should know is not true and that we're having this exchange here is evidence enough that it isn't, nevermind others. Second, here's your other BIG lie, you say others """"have tried to explain you in clearest possible words the difference between numeral symbols and numeral system"""", Oh really? why don't you tell everyone here that it is I who made the clearest distinction and as far as I remember and see on the page I was the first to make it between numeral symbols and numeral system, and you should know because you have been around. I clearly distinguished in my first post between the Arabic Numerals (1, 2, 3, 4...) and the Hindu-Arabic Numeral system in a paraphragh that begins with """"- For a start,"""" Talk:History_of_Indian_and_Arabic_numerals#RFC_2 and you should especially know, not just because youhave been around, but also because what you quoted above happens to be just the paragraph under it!  And again I made the distinction in """"the clearest possible words"""" when I proposed here, as my first(!) point in an suggested outline,  Talk:History_of_Indian_and_Arabic_numerals#Suggested_outline.2C_please_consider_and_discuss """"differentiate a specific numeral script (eg, Arabic Western, Arabic Eastern, Devanagari) from the numeral system (ie, Indian-Arabic, which includes many numerals scripts), the rest of the article should maintain this, it should also keep in mind what the readers may have searched for when looking up this article and cater for those needs (eg, is the reader looking up the Arabic Western numerals script or the Indian-Arabic Numeral system?)"""", and then again zocky, who prefers my version and is against yours, made the same disctinction Talk:History_of_Indian_and_Arabic_numerals#What_this_page_is_about. The dictionary defines a liar as """"One that tells lies"""" and """"a person who has lied or who lies repeatedly"""", if you want me to stop calling pointing out your lies stop lying! csssclll ()""""

 In addition, I did *not* start the POV fork (Alternative views on Arabic numerals). 

 In addition, you are being misleading and also lying about the following """"I replied to his comment at Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#December_8, and at 22:08, asked him on Talk:Arabic numerals to respond to my comment at Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#December_8. At 22:09 he said he had already replied on that page. I replied at 22:10 saying he hasn't. At 23:38 he posted a reply on Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#December_8, and then posted a message on Talk:Arabic numerals claiming that I was blatantly """"lying"""" at 22:10 when I said he had'nt replied.

Why do you not mention that you replied to someone else on Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#December_8 at """"deeptrivia (talk) """", which I later on found and I replied to you at """"csssclll()"""", which you should be aware of because you replied at """"Thanks. deeptrivia (talk) """" but you don't mention this above!! ~Why don't you mention it?!

I can do whatever i want, and there is nothing you can do to stop me. you are without doubt the most annoying piece of shit i have ever even heard of. you are a flat out embarrasment to humankind. do the world a favour and kill yourself, ok? the world will be a better place without you. or if you can't bring yourself to do it, get someone else to do it, see if i care. you are a pathetic worm. go and burn in hell. on second thought, hell is too good for you. go to the darkest, most desolate pits of the universe and stay there in agony. you are a despondently hopeless worm who can do nothing but annoy people. even your mother probably wants to kill or maim you in some way.

To you in the U.S. is raising fanatically that do not even think that your country stinks?

Indeed, just enough so you start heiling as nazist, and you both Germany in 1939.

Fanatics are already on enough. 

Then not understand why you are not best friends with the most painful of dictatorships, such as in North Korea

indeed, he is not surprised that that your fascist state was repeatedly elected několirktá as the biggest problem in the path to world peace

HE IS CURRENTLY UNDER INVESTIGATION & SO WORRIED ABOUT IT HE IS CREATING ACCOUNTS ASKING IF HE COULD BE IN TROUBLE. HE IS. THE ONLY REAL GOLDENTONY111/112 ACCOUNTS ARE ON HERE.

Some of these uploads are music, some are comedy, some are anti BNP/EDL. None are espousing a particular movement, political group or ideology. However, due to the fact that I espouse equality and fairness & am opposed to unwarranted victimisation, oppression of minorities, hatred and ignorance it seems that certain users like to think of it as a soapbox to spew their racist, misogynistic, homophobic, xenophobic and hate-filled gibberish....the BNPers, of course, are guilty of all the aforementioned.

Apparently my decision not to allow comments that are basically spam, lazy insults, illiterate ramblings and screeching from morons who don't listen (but just use the channel as their own forum) means I am anti free speech. I don't think our ancestors fought against fascism and for the right for freedom of speech to have hate-filled knuckle draggers abuse that by screeching hate-filled drivel bereft of facts, decency or, indeed, a point.

I do actively encourage freedom of speech for all, quite often letting idiots speak makes them look far more idiotic than I ever could hope. There is a difference between debate and spamming, insulting, not listening and preaching though.

I'm happy to debate, but a debate consists of two sides discussing their views, not one shouting and refusing to listen to anyone else. It is my channel and I have the right not to allow trolls, clones, neo Nazis, racists, haters and all round ne'er do wells the right to puke bile all over it....this is not suppression of freedom of speech and if anyone cares to look back through my channel they will see I actively encourage debate, but also see how so many choose to eschew debate in favour of:
1. Attempting to belittle, hurl abuse and calling me UAF/Marxist/far left/rapist/paedophile with absolutely no basis (libelous in reality).
2. Personal insults, accusing me of being a foreigner, bringing my family into it (they love a """"mum"""" insult) and accusing me of being several users because they can't believe more than one person can disagree.
3. Misquoting, paraphrasing and cherry picking """"research"""" from questionable sources and only ever """"research"""" or accept sources that back up their own beliefs.
4. Lying, accusing me of acts I haven't done and claiming they have """"won"""" the argument when they have ignored the points I raised and just harped on and on.
5. Cloning my account on here and also using my username on far right forums. They have cloned me numerous times.
6. Waffling on about being deprived of freedom of speech (to make insults and allow no right to reply by blocking me from their channels)

Basically, these goons make up a tiny minority of incredibly arrogant, ignorant, spiteful, indecent, amoral, borderline illiterate joy sappers; BNP, EDL, neo Nazis, Islamophobes, extremists, KKK, you name it. THEY are what is wrong with the world and they are what is trying to stop us evolving; their motivation is hatred and ignorance....proven by their labelling of everyone who disagrees with them as communists, UAF, Marxists and Liberals (and more unbelievably fascists?!?) with no basis. Of course, they are just lazy epithets to group the majority into one category when their opposition is made up of a multitude of individuals from left to right, of different coloured skin and beliefs, sexualities, classes, background etc....the majority basically.

Youtube grants these guttersnipes the anonymity to parade their ignorance and disgusting ideals and appear to be a larger group than they are. They are fooling themselves though, they will always be a minority of failures who blame their own failure in life on everyone but themselves. Ironically, our ancestors who fought for every freedom they treasure now are having it spat back in their face with every ill informed, erroneous, indecent and anti educational rant these idiots post.

I encourage debate, NOT bickering, childish playground taunts or interminable clowns on their soapbox refusing to listen to others. It is still possible to get a viewpoint across without resorting to actions a 5 year old would sneer at.

These types are incredibly easy to expose for what they are, they do half the job themselves and not one of them has yet """"defeated"""" me or shut me up. Not only do I have the majority on my side but also facts and common sense.....they have none of this. I don't proclaim to be intelligent, but I certainly have the majority of int",['malignant'],1

It doesn't matter if I'm even an obese Tongan kid. It has no bearing on content or the essentials of an argument, and anything else you might conjure to the favour of some imagined affiliation. This is aptly called speculation.

Now, I will only say two things. First one is a rehearsal of my previous suggestion: Livius.org is visited by thousands of people daily. Along with a number of other scholar-related websites, I can't live without checking it by a daily basis. It deserves a Wiki-article, where Jona Lendering is briefly described as the founder and maintainer of an outlet with roots as far back as -96. Yes, sounds like a plan of revenge. The paragon of Pan-Iranic resurgence! The removal of a Wiki-article of Lendering will remove the last great obstacle to a resurgent Achaemenid empire and the reawakening of the terrifying Persian horsemen of doom! Howl! Howl! Our world is forfeit!

Second point, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart: Get laid. Your superior-inferior complex isn't convincing anyone here, whether they be Iranian or not. There is no chance an article of this quality gets to stay. That's the bottom line, irrespective of any perceived reasoning. Either change the article so that it pertains to Livius.org, or stop your incessant whining. Maybe it never occurred to you that by simple observation Jona Lendering has written several Iran-friendly articles and has generally sought to dispel several popular misconceptions on the ancient Iranians. Maybe that's how you make more drama in your life, by arbitrary holier-than-thou attitude.

Apparently it all came flooding back to him, he was reliving the whole trip! He was yelling out and jumping on his seat like it was a rollercoaster, ducking and diving, shouting 'SHIT! LOOK OUT! GODDAM BATS!' That was fantastic – if he thought we'd captured it, then we must have done it.

The only reason I put it there is because no-one listens elsewhere, I won't get a response to this, because you know you wrong, sure I did ruin his page, but I didn't attack him, I just had to make sure he understands (hey I can admit where I went wrong, can you?). But of course if you don't agree with the admin on wikidelusion you should fuck-off right? Can I have a structured debate about the actions against myself and the user Eddieebo, debating against the collective admin of wikipedia, primarily the people who imposes actions on myself and Eddieebo? Or are you afriad to be proven wrong yet again?",['rude'],1

Cena = Gets too much shit from people for no reason. He can't control the way he is booked. I just believe they should stop pushing him before everyone hates him way too much or just turn him heel which would work for me.

Orton = Does whatever the fuck he wants because he is a main star and friends with Triple H. Should have been fired already for smoking pot in front of everyone. If it wasn't for Triple H, he would be jobbing in TNA right now. Fuck him, that son of a bitch does not deserve the spot he has. He is good of the mic but ring skills lack, headlock after headlock.

"Is Deepak the ruler of the world? 

Let me give you people who love this guy/girl Deepak....An idea of what Deepak is like....He must be some really unhappy person......i promoise you this is what it is like in dealing with Deepak. 

I bring up an issue where im asking why an article does not have more info, or about editing an article, or about taking something out of an article. 

And Deepak wont allow me to make edits. 

So I give Deepak examples and information and trying to back up my edits are legit. 

And Deepak ignores my logic and doesnt give me alot of logic as to why my info is not valid then 

So I try to figure out why Deepak is being so strcit. I remind him that i backed up what i said. That i had information that was logical. And why my edits are good. 

And Deepak calls me a troll and insults me and accuses me of being a nazi lover or something

So I answer every insult, every accustation , and every put down that Deepak gives me. And then i remind him of why my edits are valid.

And Deepak ignores most of what i write and continues to call me a troll. Or a nazi lover. Or other insults. 

I then get annoyed and ask Deepak why is he ignoring most of my logic that i write down? Why does he pick and choose what he wants to answer? Why does he not give me logic in return? 

And Deepak wont reply . 

I then ask other users about making edits and asking them about my logic and giving them my reasons as to why my edits are valid. And some answer and some agree and some dont. 

And Deepak all of a sudden starts responding again....with logic? No....with answers? no....with reasoning? no....with information? no....he tells the other users that im a troll and a nazi and pro India then . 

I then answer all of Deepaks insults. I remind him of why i want edits to be made. I give him my information as to why  my edits are valid then. 

And Deepak goes back calling me a troll, and a nazi, and a pro India dude. 

And this kind of stuff goes on and on and on...you get the idea.....he ignores information you give him. He picks and chooses what he wants to answer. And he doesnt even answer the logic you give him sometimes. But he wastes his time in name calling, and insluts, and putting you down then. 

So then after a while i get annoyed. And i remind him how things got this bad between us. I type and type and type and type just like i am now. 

And Deepak ignores most of what i typed. 

Many times i write him these long replies where i answer all his points, where i tell him why its wrong for him to insult me and put me down, and why its wrong for him to ignore the information i have as to why i want to make an edit, or whatever it is im bringing up then.....and no matter how much i write....even if i write these long replies to him then....even if i answer every point he brings up....he usually either ignores most of what i wrote down....or....he picks and chooses what he wants to answer.....or.....he just responds back by calling me a troll, or accusing me of being pro nazi or something, or accusing me of ignoring his points (which is so not true cus i respond to pretty much everything he says then), or accusing me of not understanding what he is telling me, or just accusing me of being pro India then (which I am) or just insulting me, or just name calling me, or just putting me down. 

So then after a while i get so annoyed cus he's this a guy here then with me now, and so i start to call him names. I call him a dictator. I call him the ruler of wikiepdia. And I tell him how he ignores my points. 

And then Deepak tells me how i cant call him names, and how i cant throw mud at him, and how im breaking wikipedia rules

So then I ask him how comes its ok for him to name call me and i cant? How come its ok for him to throw mud at me but I cant then? How come its ok for him to break Wikipedia's rules but I can't then? 

And Deepak has no logical answer....or....he won't respond to those questions that I ask him then . Or he just ignores what i ask him, and goes back to accusing me of being a troll, or acting like im a pro nazi or something then , or just insult's me in general then......

So then I get more annoyed and call him thing's like a dictator, which as you can see here with our history, this is how he acts.....isn't it true?.....he ignores most of my points and picks and chooses what he wants to answer.....sometimes he won't even answer you at all.....and sometime's he just insults you then . So it's logical if get annoyed and call him a dicator right?

Wrong....Deepak then holds it against you that your name calling him...and threaten's to block you, or report you, or he just tel",['malignant'],1

 MY STATEMENT 

AND WHAT IS IT I DID EXACTLY TO BE BANNED?
WILL SOMEBODY PLEASE EXPLAIN?
You are obviously not aware of what is goinf ´g on I am ban for not contributing at all with the talk page!! what ? I am the one who asked for this mediation for more than 2 weeks ago and it was for something else than that and this snowskinner who was asked to bring the arbitration knows it perfectly. And i am the one working out ot bring the two best cosmolog in the world to look at those thesis, ans I am the one who did contributed the most in this affair together with Igor Bogdanov, at the refute of those falsifications of evidencies presented here by ybm and his acolytes.
I was ban because ybm had been ban and couldn't stand it.
But where he was ban 24 hours for insulting repaeatridly people and calling Igor Bogdanov a bastard 3 times and for having on several occassions oversteped the 3RR rule, I was ban 3 x 24 hours for having presented an article who was evaluated by Bidhonene who is a very endeared friend of YBM, for not being so usefull as she wish.
An article containing of course a serie of evidenscies who didn't have been shown before, and who constiture a major block against the conspiratorial arguments of ybm and his gang.
Just as she did it here on my talk page when she deleeted it all, and vnever reinserted it, a precious document proving the ´factual connection between YBM and this Voyer who infatuated this whole affair.
It was YBM who had invited his friend on my talkpage, until he realized that i had an arbitration going on that was about this.
Bishonen blocked me 20 minutes after her protegé had been blocked.
i dont see any of her interventions in this talk page concerning the insults of rjb and ybm, nor concerning their cynical and very empty and longs comments about my mediation on the talk page tonight.
You can read my articles yourself and see how hard I was fighting to make sure that the situation will not degenerate further, and to calm down the spirit.
She didn't make an intervention there to ask rjb and ybm to stop their acction and provocating attitudes, nor accused them for saying nothing nor removed their articles for not improving the talk page, nor contributing with anything on it.
She has already been told to don't interfeer anymore on this talk page because she is unable to differentiate between  her liking and her work as an admi.
She does not follow the rules and do a very destructiv work, using retaliation and arbitrarious judgement all the time, and always something who arranged ybm very much.
She even do revert for him and use her status to commit illegitimate stuff.
The arbitration should have been about this too.
They are using the fact that mediator Nicholas turnbull is out for a week to do their bad deeds.
And this snowsnippers know that what he does is out of hand, and that he should never have done it.
He even insulted Nicholas turnbull.
Easy when people aren't there to defend themselves.
Wiki english is a spot on the face of Wikipédia, admi are behaving like sabotors and vandaliser and encourage riot, and abuse of their knoledge and power to undermine actions made to refrein their wrong doing.

This has to stop.
I asked for a mediation and an arbitration comity for more than two weeks and Sowspinners actions are completely unlegitimate.
He has stollen MY mediation and MY arbitration request.
This don't go and has to be aborted.
I do not recognise the actual arbitration for being legitimate, and thereby ask all to boycot it.

None of the involved administrator can in anyway be part of the arbitration comity or of the arbitration.
It is a close debate and not an arena game.
THis arbitration was supposed to be hold secret, as snowspinner knows very well, and took some very unlucky initiatives from the very beginning.
He is an idiot to have done that, and has no sens of responsability, nor of maturity, and cannot be trusted.
He must be removed as well.
i dont accept what happened tonight. There was absolutly no reasons for me to be blocked and certainly not for 3 days.
If I say fuck! like ybm nothing happen, but if I bring precious evidencies, so I am ban and the evidencies confiscated and destroy yes, and detroyed as they have been alredy here several times.
This is the sign of a totalitarian system, and wiki english has became a totalitarian system, where the judged perform the judgement, and were all proofs are stollen and destroyed and were disturbing people are threaten for their meaning and impert to say more, and blocked away.

I hope that's not the case here.  Go ahead and call that what I just described a conspiracy. I dare you- in fact I double-dog-dare you! It is declassified and admitted and on a participating government website. I'll assume good faith, perhaps it is ignorance of the subject on your parts. It ok, I'm ignorant of a lot of wikipedia editing stuff. Belief in documented past history is the not the same as a belief in some conspiracy theory crap. Based on you comments about me, this is a concept you appear to be having trouble with. Any competent person would understand they are not the same. Is there was one available to you to explain it? I was explained to you repeatedly on this page and on my talk page. You are pretty dense of you don't have it yet.  You will find that my primary sources are 100 times more accurate than anything you'll ever find on about this fringe topic.  I am a subject matter expert on certain aspects of CBW and exposures but not on chem trails but no about to out myself to convince you.  Government declassified primary sources on WP are to be used sparingly. People like you make it difficult to talk about serious subjects. Reasonable people should not be constrained in their edits by pure ignorance unless ignorance is the consensus (TBD).  You are unable to consider ever it which speaks to your credibility.

You’re a putrescent mass, a walking vomit. You are a spineless little worm deserving nothing but the profoundest contempt. You are a jerk, a cad, a weasel. Your life is a monument to stupidity. You are a stench, a revulsion, a big suck on a sour lemon.
You are a bleating foal, a curdled staggering mutant dwarf smeared richly with the effluvia and offal accompanying your alleged birth into this world. An insensate, blinking calf, meaningful to nobody, abandoned by the puke-drooling, giggling beasts who sired you and then killed themselves in recognition of what they had done.
I will never get over the embarrassment of belonging to the same species as you. You are a monster, an ogre, a malformation. I barf at the very thought of you. You have all the appeal of a paper cut. Lepers avoid you. You are vile, worthless, less than nothing. You are a weed, a fungus, the dregs of this earth. And did I mention you smell?
Try to edit your responses of unnecessary material before attempting to impress us with your insight. The evidence that you are a nincompoop will still be available to readers, but they will be able to access it more rapidly.
You snail-skulled little rabbit. Would that a hawk pick you up, drive its beak into your brain, and upon finding it rancid set you loose to fly briefly before spattering the ocean rocks with the frothy pink shame of your ignoble blood. May you choke on the queasy, convulsing nausea of your own trite, foolish beliefs.
You are weary, stale, flat and unprofitable. You are grimy, squalid, nasty and profane. You are foul and disgusting. You’re a fool, an ignoramus. Monkeys look down on you. Even sheep won’t have sex with you. You are unreservedly pathetic, starved for attention, and lost in a land that reality forgot.
And what meaning do you expect your delusional self-important statements of unknowing, inexperienced opinion to have with us? What fantasy do you hold that you would believe that your tiny-fisted tantrums would have more weight than that of a leprous desert rat, spinning rabidly in a circle, waiting for the bite of the snake?
You are a waste of flesh. You have no rhythm. You are ridiculous and obnoxious. You are the moral[size] equivalent of a leech. You are a living emptiness, a meaningless void. You are sour and senile. You are a disease, you puerile one-handed slack-jawed drooling meat slapper.
On a good day you’re a half-wit. You remind me of drool. You are deficient
in all that lends character. You have the personality of wallpaper. You are dank and filthy. You are asinine and benighted. You are the source of all unpleasantness. You spread misery and sorrow wherever you go.
You smarmy lager lout git. You bloody woofter sod. Bugger off, pillock. You grotty wanking oink artless base-court apple-john. You clouted boggish foot-licking twit. You dankish clack-dish plonker. You gormless crook-pated tosser. You churlish boil-brained clotpole ponce. You cockered bum-bailey poofter. You craven dewberry pisshead cockup pratting naff. You gob-kissing gleeking flap-mouthed coxcomb. You dread-bolted
fobbing beef-witted clapper-clawed flirt-gill.
You are a fiend and a coward, and you have bad breath. You are degenerate,
noxious and depraved. I feel debased just for knowing you exist. I despise everything about you, and I wish you would go away.
I cannot believe how incredibly stupid you are. I mean rock-hard stupid.
Dehydrated-rock-hard stupid. Stupid so stupid that it goes way beyond the stupid we know into a whole different dimension of stupid. You are trans-stupid stupid. Meta-stupid. Stupid collapsed on itself so far that even the neutrons have collapsed. Stupid gotten so dense that no intellect can escape. Singularity stupid. Blazing hot mid-day sun on Mercury stupid.
You emit more stupid in one second than our entire galaxy emits in a year. Quasar stupid. Your writing has to be a troll. Nothing in our universe can really be this stupid.

It had been six years since we had graduated from college, and for the first time since graduation, all three of us were together again. From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.

Having returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.

As I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.

The conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.

It felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.

The intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.

No words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.

I awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while Beth and I held each other as she slept.","['malignant', 'rude', 'abuse']",1

Again, I never asserted the Greaseman's death.

Since Neturalhomer chooses to edit his User Talk page to erase the past, I will post the relevant exchange here (he gave """"removing vandalism"""" as the reason for editing it out; his only tool is a hammer, perhaps, so he sees me as a nail, perhaps)

Your Lie(s) About Me

You wrote: """"Final Warning

Saying things like """"DC101 IS HIS FUCKING EMPLOYER!!!"""" and """"Don't be a douche"""" is a good way to get blocked....fast. Tone the language down...and pay attention. Greaseman ain't dead. If you continue, to add continued, now, lies to Wikipedia, I will report you to AIV and to your ISP, Verizon. Stop now, this is your final warning. - NeutralHomer • Talk """"

Yes, I did use the language (on a talk page) and if it will make the booboo feel better, I apologize. But who doesn't enjoy a nice summer's eve?

BUT, you need to STOP LYING about me. I never said the Greaseman was dead, only that his death had been reported by sources considered reliable by Wikipedia standards. A little attention to detail on your part would be much appreciated, Eve. Otherwise, perhaps it is I who shall report you. Tell you what: you admit and retract your lie and I will consider the matter closed. Fair?

Let's look at your odd writing style: """"If you continue, to add continued, now, lies to Wikipedia,"""" Just what are you going for there?

I've never put a lie on Wikipedia, contrary to your assertion. Anyone who lies about me can go screw.

Your threat to report me to my ISP (FOR WHAT, EVE?) is beyond pathetic. Two pops for yes!! Report away.

Now, the admin who blocked me said that more than one reliable source was needed on sensitive matters.  He did not research sufficiently to reach a correct conclusion.

Let's all remember, shall we, that I never said that Greaseman was dead, simply that he was REPORTED DEAD.  There's a big difference, and the fact that it was reported is not in dispute.  I NEVER SAID GREASEMAN WAS DEAD.  Yet Neutralhomer continues to assert that I did.  THAT IS A LIE.  I consider someone lying about me a personal attack, under Wikipedia guidelines.  Is this a """"separate but equal"""" or """"separate and unequal"""" system?

The admin who blocked me wants more than one source that someone said something on the radio.  Let's look at Wikipedia's entry on Cesar Romero's personal life, shall we?  There is NO source cited for his death, nor his homosexuality, yet those are all sensitive topics, are they not?  Why doesn't Neutralhomer report the author of this page for vandalism?

The fact that Neutralhomer claims that dealing with me gave him a migraine on the talk page of the admin who blocked me demonstrates that this is a personally based effort on his part.

To recap: I never lied.  I never vandalized.  That should be enough.

Now let's look at Wikipedia's reckless report of Cesar Romero's death and homosexuality, shall we?  Sensitive matters, no?

Personal life

Romero believed in liberation theology. Romero was very Christian yet still believed in a utopian society whose belief is that Christ's kingdom would be very similar to Marx's envisionment of communism, and held to this belief until his death.[1][2]

Romero always claimed his grandfather on his mother's side was Cuban poet and patriot José Martí, although his mother's parents were legally Carmen and Manuel Mantilla with José Martí as his godfather. There was some speculation that Maria was fathered by Martí who was a boarder in the Mantilla household, but he never claimed Maria as his daughter in his lifetime.

Romero was never married, despite proposing to at least one woman. Romero made regular appearances on the Hollywood social circuit, usually in the company of an attractive actress, and he was almost always described in interviews and articles as a """"confirmed bachelor."""" Romero discussed his homosexuality in a series of interviews with author Boze Hadleigh, with the understanding that they would not be published during his lifetime.

Romero wore a man's tennis bracelet inscribed with his favorite nickname: """"Butch."""" The term was reportedly bestowed on Romero by his one-time dancing partner Joan Crawford, who teased Romero by telling him: """"You're so butch!"""" While Romero's homosexuality was an """"open secret"""" in Hollywood, the movie-going public was unaware of his sexual proclivities and there was never any embarrassing scandal surrounding his male liaisons, which shows the care and finesse with which he conducted his private life for more than 60 years.

Romero was a mainstay of the Hollywood social circuit until his death in 1994. He was interred at Inglewood",['rude'],1

"First of all, I've never been blocked before.

Next, let me be clear: Mr. User:Aboutmovies vandalized an article. Then he argued with and ultimately attacked Pcap, the editor who reverted the vandalism. Then Pcap, presumably out of frustration, asked me for help, as I was the one who had provided most of the original text for that article.  I am not active much anymore on wikipedia, so I mostly just I commiserated on Pcap's talk page. I told him I would not get involved. (Why am I not active? Because there are too many assholes like User:Aboutmovies allowed to run free, making life shitty for everyone.)  

Now Mr. User:Aboutmovies, apparently having too much time on his hands, snoops through my personal communications on Pcap's talk page. And so, after putting his nose where it doesn't belong, he gets his nose out of whack, and comes to my personal talk page, and attacks me. Why? This guy clearly owed Pcap an apology. He could have offered an apology. He could have quietly slunk off with his tail between his legs, and repented in private. No, instead of doing the right, honorable thing, he instead chooses to attack me. (So who is escalating? He is.) So I called him an asshole, which he richly deserves. So then he escalates some more: he gets you to block me.  You were sucked right into his game.  You did not bother to do any due diligence. AT ALL. You should have blocked him, not me.  Once you realized your mistake, which Pcap points out to you above, you could have offered me an apology, turned around, and blocked Aboutmovies instead. Did you bother to do any of these things?

This needed to be clarified since there has been a problem with him inserting subsequent posts ahead of mine, which can be misleading to a reader.

So when I objected to his use again of the word """"fucking"""" he then used it at me two more times, as reflected above. This follows a prior incident a few weeks ago when he used the word """"fucking"""" at me. I repeatedly objected and asked him not to do that. I think he did this again because he knew it would upset me because of how upset I was about the prior incident. 

Also, I have been called by someone else a """"bitch"""" and the words """"cunt"""" and """"cock"""" """"shit"""" have been directed at me on this Talk page.

Hate speech is serious, Mr Malber.  As I recall, your involvement with Wikipedia Review was because you were guilty of hate speech, in that you suggested that """"people with autism should not be allowed to edit Wikipedia"""".  Malber, you are a poor person to comment on such an issue.  You should have been banned from Wikipedia for your comments, yet here you remain, continuing with your hate speech.  You are quite correct that Amorrow engaged in hate speech, although of a lesser variety of the kind used by you.  He was banned, as you were.  You, Malber, were banned for hate speech.  Did you forget this?  Perhaps you forgot this.  The place that is the only place devoted to criticism of Wikipedia is indeed important.  You can disagree with as much of it as you like.  Criticism, by its very nature, is not generally accepted by those who it is critical of.  This does not illegitimise it.  There are many and varied very legitimate criticism.  One such criticism is why a hate-monger such as yourself is not banned from Wikipedia.  Perhaps you are biased in this however.  Perhaps you'd like to argue how you are less of a hate speaker than anyone who has ever posted on Wikipedia Review.  As far as our evidence has proven, you are much worse than the worst on WR.

There is a confusion between the different definitions of heterosexuality.

I think if we reorganize the page like the homosexual page this distinction would be more clear.  For example, it would make clear that reproduction results from heterosexual sex, not from a heterosexual orientation.

Hi. It's from the same user who was changing the images before on similar articles. Not to mention that, both images are good resolutions, contrary to what the user says, which is why I don't see the need to change images, delete galleries and remove content. It's unnecessary.

 A hit list for Jews 
There is a site called Jew Watch out there (I'll let you find the link) which specialises in """"keeping an eye on Jewish activities"""".  It is used as a reference site by anti-semites the world around.  Jew Watch makes it a point to make sure that they do not, under any circumstances, list someone who they cannot confirm 100% is Jewish.  Stormfront, a white supremist web forum, uses Jew Watch all of the time.

The criteria for inclusion on List of British Jews is the same criteria used by Jew Watch.  It is a criteria designed for anti-semites.  It is a criteria that is aimed in hurting Jews.

Jewish communities do not have such a criteria.  They allow anyone to be considered to be a Jew if they have any linkage with the Jewish community, through race, religion or culture.  This is the normal criteria that is used.  If your father is Jewish, then per Jewish community standards, you are Jewish.  And so forth.

Wikipedia as a whole has certain criteria for verifiability.  But these criteria are not being applied to this list.  This is being changed purely because this is a Jewish list.  Whilst Slim Virgin and her friends have claimed that this is in order to stop muslim terrorists, this is plainly not true.  If we are worried about terrorists strapping bombs to their bodies and blowing up Jews, then this list shouldn't exist at all.  And we should especially not try to focus on who are the """"real Jews"""".  Wikipedia are changing their rules, purely to push an anti-semetic point of view.  And while Slim Virgin goes around claiming that others who oppose her are neo-nazis, and ignoring their strong ties to the Jewish community, she herself has been unable to answer the questions about her own religious hatred.  And this is the same person who has supported muslim POV pushers, who have written vehement anti-semetic text throughout Wikipedia.  Slim Virgin has been a catalyst for banning people who have opposed these islamofascists.  Slim Virgin is an anti-semite.

Right now, I would encourage deletion of this list.  It is being run by anti-semites and used to harm all Jewish people.  Until such time as Slim Virgin can be banned from editing this and related pages, it is dangerous to continue to have such a page.  It is encouraging hatred of Jews.""",['loathe'],1

That is absolutely false.
You posted a """"civility warning"""" in my talk page.
That was the only time that you posted there, ever, for this issue.
My reaction to that, was to come here to ask what happened.
We discussed it here, and when the discussion ended, without any result, I removed the civility warning from my talk page, because I use to archive / remove old conversations in my talk page.
Automatically, wen you saw I had removed the civility warning, you blocked me for a 24 hour period.
Your block was absolutely illegitimate, for various reasons:
The way you did it:
The reason you gave to block me was: """"Yes, I've seen the comment on your talk page. This was the combination of mine and his responses to your previous question."""". And few minutes later, you posted """"24 hour block issued"""".
All this information was posted in your own talk page, and talking to another user.
You did not communicate to me that you had blocked me. I did not see that you had blocked me until, few days later the block had expired, I came to your talk page, and saw that you had said that you had blocked me.
In addition, by not communicating me that I was blocked, you did not allow me to ask other admins to review my block.
The reasons why you did it:
It is not stated anywhere in this Wikipedia that an user cannot remove stuff from his talk page.
You neither told me not to remove that stuff.
I accepted and fulfilled your request of having a civil attitude. Ignoring what I had done before (which was not much), since the moment you told me that, I kept a civil attitude.
I also lost my time coming here to reply you, so there is no possible way to say that I ignored your request.
In all, your block was just full of irregularities. It was not a normal admin block, but rather a thoughtless decission that you took without following any kind of procedure. You just decided that I had to be blocked because you might think that removing the civility warning that you had posted in my talk page was some kind of lack of respect towards you. But it is frankly stupid to think that way, because of the reasons I've explained above.
And since you realized that you had comitted an enormous mistake, that you had used your admin powers despotically, you just repeatedly ignored the requests that I did to you in your own talk page, where I asked you why had you blocked me (this one, and this one), adding to your unjustified attitude towards me, a high grade of arrogance.
In addition, you are threatening me. Read well what I wrote:
""""Hello? Why did you block me? Since when removing a civility warning from one's talk page is something that deserves a block? You did not even communicate my block to my talk page. I am stil waiting for a justification of your abusive attitude as admin. You not only block for no reason but you also ignore people's requests of justification!"""".
Where do you see a lack of respect here? Where do you see that I """"keep"""" an uncivil attitude? Honestly, you are the one being uncivil: """"if you carry on in the line you are takng, you will be blocked again"""" ... which line I am takng? And why do you threaten me? """"If you do not wish to contribute constructively to the encyclopedia, then we shall make sure that you do not prevent others from contributing"""" ... oh, """"we"""". This sounds to me more like a street gang threatening a poor pedestrian, than an admin giving wise advices to a poor Wikipedian. Go to my user page and see the articles I've created. Isn't that a positive contribution?
Look: I am not being uncivil; it is you, the one being disrespectful with me. And I am not ignoring your requests of being civil; I am fulfilling them. And it is rather you, who are not only ignoring my requests of justification for the actions you carried out against me, but also threatening me with new repressive measures.  """,['malignant'],1

 The Truth About Me, Stephen 

Hello, you sexy little love-hole!
I am seeking hot, kinky sex; that is why I am here.  I am seeking a large, hairy, ape-like man to discipline me.  I like it when big men talk dirty to me whilst pounding their rock-hard schingslongs into my mangina; just thinking about it makes my tiny little micro-penis perk up like Hitler on meth. I want a big, strong man to beat me up whilst another muscular hunk restrains me and whispers obscenities into my innocent little ear.  I especially like it when I am called 'a cum-guzzling, dick-sucking, fellating, felching, shit-sniffing, nigger-worshipping, homosexual man-slut,' for I know, in my heart, that this description of me is extremely accurate.  Please, big, hairy men, I want to be your ass-slave, serving you and satisfying you with my bunghole for as long as my submissive soul remains in this world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1111one1111won11  I will even pay you large sums of money if that is necessary.

 Adult-child sex & child sexual abuse 

Copied from WP:ANI ohio 

 I've asked this question before, but I've never had an understandable explanation:  How is the article a POV fork?  If it's been explained previously, just point me to the diff.  I've seen plenty of people say it's a POV fork, but what I see is a value-neutral etic approach to a topic that's as old as humanity itself.  Even if the title is POV, the content can be used in other articles, so why delete it? ohio 

 """"Adult-child sex"""" is a euphemism (for child sexual abuse), and any article titled """"Adult-child sex"""" is prima facie assumed to be apologistic for child sexual abuse. Exactly as if someone took an article """"Nazi genocide"""" and retitled (or made a fork) entitled """"Nazi demographic adjustments"""". We understand that you don't agree with this but if you still don't understand it then you had better look to yourself.   

 Exactly as Hero said. As a contemporary example, Ethnic Cleansing and Genocide. One is just a fancy name for the other.  •   •  • 03:41 (UTC)  6 Mar '08

I don't see the logic of that.  Adult-child sex (the term) goes no further than plain description.  I can see where some editors were trying to insert POV material about child sexual abuse into the article, but I don't see how it logically follows that the term itself becomes a euphemism for child sexual abuse.  The term itself can advance no agenda.  It is materially different from the genocide = demographic adjustments example, which may invoke Godwin's law.  As for VP's example, ethnic cleansing means something different from (but related to) genocide, just as adult-child sex does with child sexual abuse.  The repeated assertion has been made that the term itself is POV.  Where is the POV in it?  Since this seems not to be much of an AN/I question, I invite replies at my talk page. ohio """,['malignant'],1

So far and far, Harry the Dirty Dog  this user is doing vandalism and it seems he is not allowing for us to remove the non-reliable sources and references. 
Also this user seems to have a personal agenda to secure this as far as possible, and seems to me, this user Harry the Dirty Dog  is on a personal agenda of defaming this lady. There is no proof and this is a rumour according to me and is supposed to be dismissed. If any one needs to research then one must google up and find out what she is up to!

This whole conversation is rediculous as the colors on a flag are meant to represent different ideas or ideals. What we decide to call that color has everything to do with what is meant by that color. By calling it yellow one is neglecting to fully appreciate the meaning behind the choice of gold as a flag color is meant to convey an idea, that of eternal and original wealth and prosperity. It has nothing to do with being high and mighty regarding the naming of a color. That is a reactionary and frankly stupid position to hold. Flags are symbols meant to illustrate various ideas and they use images and colors, like all other forms of symbolism, to do this. Thus, the use of gold on a flag is in no way an attempt to sound more high and mighty, but rather a way to communicate.... you dolt",['malignant'],1

It had been six years since we had graduated from college, and for the first time since graduation, all three of us were together again. From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.

Having returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.

As I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.

The conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.

It felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.

The intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.

No words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.

I awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while Beth and I held each other as sh","['malignant', 'rude', 'abuse']",1

 Geez Hesp, as well as being a coward you are a little paranoid, sorry very paranoid, you should also call your Mummy and Daddy. 
In case you are stupid as well as paranoid and a coward, speaking face to face is the old fashoined way of sorting out problems as opposed to hiding behind a pretty name in a cyber veil; you pathetic little excuse for a man.   —Preceding unsigned comment added by Gregjay (talk • contribs)

 you are obviously a bigoted racist, as you have not removed the page for Gordon (name) which is an article about a name. Yet you are removing articles about names of people from a nation you clearly have something against.

 But it does not surprise me, at all. Most people who deal with IT are of a limited intellectual capacity, especially when it copmes to evaluating their own shortcomings (cf. http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/kateconnolly/3637231/Are_you_a_Fachidiot/ ), and even more so when they have not actually graduated from a university but are self-taugt like you appear to be.

 In any case, your blatant Serbophobia in removing start up articles about the names of a culture that you disparage is a disgrace to Wikipedia in English.

 BTW, I deleted the nonsense you posted on my talk page. Do not do that ever again. It is unwanted and unacceptable. I will not be posting here any more either, and I will report you to Meta Wiki as a racist unfit to work on the site.",['malignant'],1

"CLIMATE? PLEASE! 

What IDIOT suggested Russell, Kansas has a humid subtropical climate? There is no way in hell Russell, Kansas could be classified as humid subtropical. It is either humid continental or semi-arid steppe, and I would lean toward the latter, since this part of Kansas is not nearly as humid and does not receive near the rainfall as the eastern half of the state. If Kansas Citywhich is at the same latitude as Russellis classified as humid continental, there is no earthly reason why Russell, which is nearly five derees farther WEST in longitude can be humid subtropical.","['malignant', 'abuse']",1

 Reply to """"On gender"""" 

Your posted: Don't guess at someone's gender, as you have done here.  It is uncivil, and could in fact be taken as insult.  Any argument you might have that their 'name appears to be that of a female/woman' is invalid, as you have no idea if that is their name, last name, middle name.. etc.  It could even be a reference to the male comicbook character Blade, who had the name of Daywalker given to him by others in the comic book.— dαlus Contribs 

If you know your friend’s gender, spit it out, you stupid ass. Your entire posting, if you didn’t have the agenda I ascribe to you, infra, would have been “FYI: He/she is a female/male” and I would adjust accordingly. Hell, if you tell me that Dayewalker is a consortium, and I’d refer to Dayewalker as “they/it.” Don’t continue to be an ass if you post further, or understand that your further postings are unworthy of reply.

I note that you are not correcting your friend Dayewalker when she posts to you 6 days ago """"I saw that afterwards, I knew HE was topic banned but it had slipped my mind about the overall bannation. Thanks! Dayewalker (talk) 06:48, 13 July 2010."""" Are suggesting that you know that Dayewalker has completed genetic testing on the subject of her comment, so that he (Dayewalker) is not guessing at ‘his” gender (the subject of her (Dayewalker’s) comment) when he only refers to """"he’;"""" or that he (Dayewalker) has genetic evidence that the """"he"""" is actually a """"she"""" and she (Dayewalker) is insulting them by suggesting that the """"he"""" is too ballsy or pushy to be a woman/“lady.” Dayewalker is not whining about this unintended insult of either referring to a woman as “she” or equally unintended insult of referring to a man as “she.” Don't be an ass.

If Dayewalker, or anyone, is so concerned about their gender identification, and they are not an idiot, they will use a prefix like """"Mr."""" or """"Ms."""" Dayewalker has not said anything about it and it is off topic to the discussion. If you wish to join into the discussion, please feel free. On second thought, don’t join in. I have no confidence that you would answer the questions posed by the other editor either. Dayewalker (he she, they, etc.) doesn’t answer his question. Ut oh, now I’ve called Chowbok a “he.” No doubt her boyfriend/girlfriend will rush in to call me a “beast” and start a fight on the 2nd grade playground. If Dayewalker thinks that he has been called a """"sissy"""" or a """"girlie,"""" then she can address that with me. He doesn't need a mighty protector to create issues designed to get me banned. And by """"protector,"""" I mean you. You are an ass. Male. Female. Both. Neither. And of whatever ‘sexual orientation,” if any, that you wish to use to identify yourself, or not identify yourself, or feel the need to identify yourself, or feel the need to keep private, or over which you do not care.

You are continuing to misrepresent my original objection.  My objection was NOT that 'he didn't respond in 8 hours', or anything like that.  (You portrayed that as my objection, though!).  Instead, I objected that Dodo wasn't addressing MY ACTUAL OBJECTIONS.  Other than his 'driveby deletions', and a template or two, he DIDN'T respond to my complaints.  Not only  did he not address my objections within a day (as you implied my original complaint was), he didn't even EVENTUALLY address my objections!  Irresponsibly, and probably maliciously, you tried to make me look like 'the bad guy' for objecting to Dodo's repeated rapid deletions without waiting for consensus, etc.
Dodo was trying to act on the theory, 'if somebody does ANYTHING even arguably criticizable, I can slap him down repeatedly by deleting his edits, without waiting for any sort of consensus, etc.'  (Evidently, that is your position as well.)  I say, """"No!"""".  Dodo never, in detail, responded to my repeated and DETAILED complaints of his behavior.  Is the reason that 'he is busy'?  Well, if he's SO BUSY, 
why did he have enough time to repeatedly delete my posts?  Doesn't make sense, does it?  The answer is quite simple:  Dodo (and, I suspect, many other self-appointed 'Info-Nazi's' ALWAYS have time to slap down other users (that's EASY, and takes little time!), but they DON'T have enough time to actually defend their own actions when challenged!  Dodo (and many others) amount to semi-professional BUSYBODIES who strut their stuff by interfering with others' use of WP.  Stop it.

no seriousy.  the only thing i think actually did or said against your precious wikipedia policies was saying that """"if i really had my way, half of you would be shot"""".  ignoring for a while the fact that i was obviously joking, it happens to be my religious belief that the human race on a whole would be much, much better off if 95% of the population died tomorrow.  that doesn't mean i go around killing people, or making specific death threats against individuals.  and don't you actually have the sense to realize that if someone says """"OH MY GOD YOU ARE SUCH A FUCKING IDIOT, JUST GO DIE ALREADY"""" that they probably don't want you to die, or more accurately they don't care.  Very few people actually have the emotion required to sit and pray for the death of another person or group of people.  And I am not one of those people.

If you really wanted to show off what a horrible and insensitive person I am,  edit, which was on a wiki talk page, is probably not the best.  Granted, nothing pisses me off more than people who see letters like я and щ and automatically assume that whatever is written is Russian.  The Cyrillic alphabet is used in many Slavic languages, as well as central asian former soviet republics, and even Mongolia.  So I called someone an idiot.  BOO FUCKING HOO.  maybe he could have said """"What language is that?"""" instead of assuming that it was Russian.  However insulted he was by me calling him an idiot, I can guarantee you that I was at least 10 times as insulted by him calling that Russian.  I am a proud, native Russian, and will not have my culture besmirched with these allegations.

Your other example how I am a bad contributor is what, a spelling correction?  Or was it the fact that my edit summary was how I felt about the sad fact that niggers can't spell? Don't even think about raising issue of my use of the word.  I live in Harlem.  Around here, that word is used like a comma.  And before you try to tell me the difference between """"nigga"""" and """"nigger"""", there is none.  It's called a dialect.  While for some purposes, it makes sense to write things phonetically as they are pronounced by the person saying them, I find it is usually clearer to spell properly.  Also, a nigger, to me at least, is not a """"black person"""". I am not a racist. I do not even draw distinctions between people. In my holy opinion, there is a nigger inside of all of us.  People (like you, for instance) who take offense for no reason (i mean, was saying """"black people are stupid and i think they should be marginalized in society, tarred and feathered, strung up on trees, dragged through town by their enormous wangs, etc.""""?  No.  And if that is what you heard, I'd like to know why.  Are you black?  98% of the black people I know personally use the word """"nigger"""" more than I do.) are why we as a society still can't get over the silly idea that words are harmful.  Words are not harmful.  Ideas are harmful.  One particularly harmful idea is that certain words are so unspeakably horrible that nobody can be allowed to say them for any reason at all.  You want to end racism forever?  Stop freaking the fuck out every time you see the word """"nigger"""".  SERIOUSLY.  I happen to be a Priest (and a Docktor), and saving humanity is just one of my many responsibilities.  Fucks like you make me hate it, but I still do it.  That's what a good person I am.

I forgot what else I was going to complain about.  I mean, I could complain about everything on Wikipedia, not because I am uncivil, but because there are enough Wikipedos to make this community unbearable for normal, well-adjusted individuals such as myself.  If you look at all my page edits, they were all GOOD FOR THE ENCYCLOPEDIA.  Ok, there was one tiny exception - a long time ago, I saw someone changed a caption on Scottish fold to """"Winston Churchill"""".  Someone else reverted it, and I reverted it back.  I felt it was an appropriate caption to that particular image.  But everything else was beneficial to improving the quality of the content.  I may be a little hard on people who are hung up on things that are wrong, but I only do what is right.  That is why I put it on my user page.  I don't do wrong things.  If you try to argue with me, you will be in for a world of hurt.  Butthurt, to be exact.  But you have nobody to blame but yourself.  Unlike you, I actually warn people first.  But no.

{{unblock|DISCLAIMER: I do not identify as a Nazi, Neo-Nazi, Facist, Neo-Fascist. I do not accept or agree with the actions or views of Hitler or any other dictators in the world for that matter. I do not hate Jews... in fact I have many jewish friends...
Hello, although this is technically an unblock appeal, it is really only a reason to explain.... you won't be in a mood to unblock me when I'm finished talking... )
First of all I want to apologise, I should have thought before putting the giant swastika on my page. This is the reason for that... I have a few Jewish friends, and normally we sometimes make jokes about jews and christians and things like that. I never really make jokes about the holocaust, because that never go over well with them and it is not nice... well, apparently, a joke about jews being lawyers set one of my closest friends off who is not really a jew, but claims he is.... now he thinks I am a facist, nazi, and I hate jews.... i gotreally frustrated and annoyed and so I came home and started messing around on my userpage... Second of all, i would like to ask why it is not permissable to """"self identify as a nazi""""? There are several userboxes dealing with this subject. There is even a userbox that states, """"This user identifies as a Hitlerist! WHAT THE HELL?!?!?! You will let people say they support Hitler, but you won't let them say they are nazis?!? Being a nazi does not mean that you condone Hitler or his actions, it simple means that you support the theory of the politics behind Nazism.... you can be a nazi and not support the horrible eugenics policy. But if you are hitlerist, that obviously says you support all that... your arguement would of course be that it is offensive to jews.... well if you are taking that into account, then you should also ban anyone that says they identify as a communist. That can be extremely offensive to christians... if you want me to, I can talk about all the horrible things they did to christians in communist russia (with reference of a nice book). I think I will... one of the things they did was putting shackles on the ankles and wrists of christians with spikes of the inside that cut into your skin if you moved at all... and then they put starved rats into your cell that tried to eat you alive so you had to fight them off while your wrists and ankles are killing you. They also tied you to a cross and hung you upside down over a huge pile of other prisoners crammed into a small room. You were then forced to excrete over everyone. You were also stood upright in a box while they drove long nails into it. It was alright if you stood perfectly still, but you would have to stand there for hours and then your body would sway and poke into the nails. They also stood you naked in a freezer with a doctor nearby that signalled when you were freezing to death and then they would take you out and warm you up. They would do that for hours on end. Then they would beat you over and over again asking you to renounce Christ... the holocaust was horrible, but I would rather be gassed or hung by a nazi than endure those tortures for 18 years like one man who wrote a book about his experiences... so could you ban all communists please? 
My last comment is in response to Chzz's question about me making the 'gay comment' statement. Nowadays the word gay is used for two meanings... one is homosexuality and the other is wierd, stupid, dumb... i was using the second connotation.... maybe if you people didn't spend so much time on this gay... sorry... stupid online encyclopedia you would realize how the real world uses words...
Even if you unblock me (which you won't... )...) I will take a wikibreak... i don't want to become addicted to point of ruining my social life...... i have already recieved a punishment, never becoming an admin (the whole gay... sorry... dumb trust thing)... just know this... i would have enventually removed the swastika after I cooled down and because of your gay... sorry... dumb policy you have lost a serious editor... this whole thing has really annoyed me...
  
(P.S. Chzz, I have been on Wikipedia for 2 years... you think I forgot to sign my gay... sorry... stupid post? yeah right!)

"In defence of China! 

Hey Koreans, who the fuck do you think you're dealing with. Guess what, Gaogouli was a Chinese vassal you stupid fucks. After the fall of the Tang Dynasty, close to 700,000 were incorporated into Tang history, a little less than half migrated to the Central Plains, 100,000 to the Chinese state of Bohai and only 100,000 into Xinluo (Silla). Most Gaogouli descendants are Chinese.

With the sole exception of Ansi fort itself, Tang troops destroyed Gaogouli soldiers on the battlefield, despite being a significantly smaller force. If anything, Gaogouli only DEFENDED itself from assaults from Sui and Tang. Gaogouli was a mere Chinese vassal, nothing more. The greatest threat came from the TuBo, TuJue and HuiHe from the west. Koreans are a bunch of fucking attention whores.

You fucking barbarian kimchi gooks have a lot of nerve to badmouth your former masters, considering the fact that you were our little dog for most of your existance. Not to mention your stupid kings would submit to the Imperial envoy in the direction of the Great Emperor of China. Fucking barbarian gooks got a lot of nerve to mess with us.

 Practical proposal for change based on evidence provided above 
Simple to read for assholes who refuse to read:
Proposals:
1) change phrasing in intro
2) do not change focus of the majority of the page on the """"close circle""""
3) perhaps make """"writers"""" section more reader friendly for casual readers with a chart, or something quick and simple to read
4) change naming of """"writers"""" section to something reflected broader scope
5) I would like something like 3 & 4 to be closer to the top, but I do recognize Doom's concern that it weighs down the intro, so we can see for now if it works.

I'm suggesting no change beyond that, but I feel I have provided the beginning of sufficient evidence to support the necessity of this change.

The band promotes Croatian patriotism and ultra-nationalism, and sings about topics such as the love for one's country, family and religion, but also about the hatred of Serbs and Croatian social democrats. Dealing with such topics has made the band controversial. Perković has been known to openly promote Ustaša ideology because he wears black clothes, salutes in the corresponding way and had often openly supported the Ustaše and the NDH in his statements to the media. 

Ultra-nationalism?Ultra-nationalism means that you want to destroy everything that is not of your nation.While patriotism means that you love your own nation,but you respect others.Where in his songs does he promote hate to other nations?And no mentioning songs created in time of war against the Serbs,because it was the time of war.And only mention songs written by him.Not what he is accused of performing.

 Hatred toward SDP?Where?Name source.He is right wing,that si widely known.Of course he disagrees with their politics and he considers their politics bad for Croatia,but hatred? Reliable source please.

Where does he promote openly Ustashe?Citation please.Because he wears black clothes?Are all rockers Ustashe?By this,rock 'n' roll is equal fascism.He is a rock singer,of course he wears black clothes.
Salute he uses is an old salute of Croatian nobles,that existed long before Ustashe.

Despite this, his statements confirming his support for the Ustaše actually outnumber his denouncements of this virtual NSDAP equivalent (he is noted to have publicly voiced his support for the NDH, in various degrees, to the media on at least twenty occasions). His credibility in these statements is diminished not only by this fact but also by the legal necessity to denounce any fascist movement in order to avoid further banning (or other legal action).

Again,I see that this is already discussed.Feral is not reliable,its a tabloid.Only reliable newspapers should be used.And these quotations in Feral,while they may be true,there are no links to check the meaning,because they may be taken out of contest,and they could have totally fifferent meaning ii their original contest.This is not reliable.

And one more question.A couple of months ago I translated two Perkovic's statements in Jutarnji list and Vecernji list.I've put relevant sources,links to that articles.And a picture was there also.Someone deleted all this without giving explanation on the discussion page.This is not what wikipedia is about.Any change must be explained.Shame on anyone who uses this kind of sneaky methods.",['malignant'],1

 Re: Justification for comment left which took the piss out of everything to do with your faith it seems

Well, that was longer than I anticipated for a title. Oh well. Anyway, do you think I am an arrogant, 'shithead' by reading that? or just a tad 'rant'headed?

Sorry, but your comment was abusive to me aswell, mate. 'I think you should tell him how to treat people'. Okay, I might of took the piss out of some person and I don't know if I did the 'christian' """"faith"""" aswell, I can't remeber to be honest.

But anyway, Justification...I am nice anyhow, but do get pissed. When I get pissed off with people, I get nasty. I was reading Aristophanes earlier that day (thats why it was in a poem). And all my poems have Underlying critical elements or 'praise' in them. You got the 'abusive tone' of the poem, but probably not the underlying bit. Or by the reaction of the first, you be deeply off the scale. I wonder what I said what made the 'christians' came into factor...I really can't remeber. Dam should've saved it. 

About the 'tell him that capps are for shotuing on the internet', I know that all ready. I used it for something called 'emphasis, may of heard it. Also, I was FUCKING PISSED AT THE TIME SO YOU DO FUCKING SHOUT AND SWEAR. don't you? yep...if you don't, your not human...well the swearing part you can reframe from. But your a man, so swearing is allowed. Only women where you say 'sorry for my french' (again justification, I am english that is a phrase over here > i am not just digging at the french)

So, yeah...I was on a rant for a bit...won't happen again. Unless a person is abusive to me. THEN HE WILL DIE. well not die...just lightly peotically abused...THEN HE WILL DIE...no stop with the killing? see I am mad sometimes...I am actually a comedian...so I don't take anything seriously. maybe I should...bombs away dude.

 WIKIPEDIA IS COMMUNISM!!!! 

It had been six years since we had graduated from college, and for the first time since graduation, all three of us were together again. From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.

Having returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.

As I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.

The conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.

It felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.

The intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.

No words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.

I awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while Beth and I held each other as she slept. The feel of her pajama-covered breasts against me was a welcome sensation, as it h",['malignant'],1

As you are aware, anything that i do gets reverted for no reason mainly by you; you use the WP:3RR the WP:SOCK and that stupid conciseness rubbish for your protection when really you know you are just doing it to be difficult and generally annoying. 

As i saw at the top of your page, and i quote from another twit that You are doing nothing to improve the article by constantly reverting - this occuring regularly in the following:

Louise Henriette de Bourbon-Conti - probably the best example of your obsession with having everything that way you want it; 
Henrietta Anne Stuart - i rearranged the page and added the Template:House of Stuart - clearly a tragedy;
Louise Marie Adélaïde de Bourbon-Penthièvre‎ - added titles and styles - where are they; i even tried to compromise by removing the stlyes and putting back the titles but once again you must have your way;
Victoire of France‎ - changed the awful layout along with her sister Princess Louise-Marie of France and Princess Marie Adélaïde of France 

Why?

The latter is quite amusing to me proving that you dont even read the article - you simply revert back because I did it - all I did was move the Template:House of Bourbon (France) to a different part of the page! Then you and your chronic arrogance go and revert it under the claim that there are rv excessive, redundant trivia contained in other articles then as always you groan on an on about the usual rubbish with please don't violate WP:3RR or WP:SOCK WHAT IS YOUR POINT ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Shut up!

Where is this claim about the WP:SOCK even from  - another one of your ridiculous  thoughts. I will not back down.

"Correction to Karljoos 
Karljoos, you ignorantly state that the phillipines is a hispanic country? How in the hell is that possible? Phillipino people are not spaniard nor have there been any admixture between spaniards and phillipines over the centuries. Are you ok?

Also, according to europeans (not ignorant americans), hispanic is an admixture of races in south america. Therefore, spaniards are not classified as hispanic. 

Then you state that Spanish culture has taken root in south america. This is not wholly true. Although it is true that south americans have accepted parts of Spanish culture, they still retain features of their own culture that are extremely distinct from the Spanish culture. This is compounded further by south america’s distinct racial differences, which, if you were smart, you would indeed know.

Just for the record, I am of spaniard descent. I do not consider myself hispanic in the way that ignorant stupid americans do. All europeans don’t view spaniards as hispanic, as a matter of fact. 

Also, since stupid americans consider south americans hispanic, it should be therefore fair to classify afro-americans and native americans in america as anglo-saxons also. This is due to the fact that afro-americans and native americans possess a significant amount of their bloodline to anglo-saxon admixture. As a result, I will add this fact to wikipedia’s anglo-saxon article. AND I WILL BACK THIS UP WITH GOOD SOURCES. So, I better not get idiot americans disputing this.","['malignant', 'abuse']",1

 First point - it was not only treated as mental illness, but as criminal activity.
 Second point - you should only refer to 'homosexual romance' in the lead if there is a section that deals with 'homosexual romance' in the body of the text, as the lead is a summary of what is in the body, and having ten sources does not count for much unless the terms are unpacked somewhere in the main text.  All these seem to show is that people like Giddens (who is a notable sociologist, but no authority on sexuality, sexology,  LGBT studies in general or homosexuality in particular) use the term.  If there were a link to an article Homosexual romance, which shows the term can be taken for granted, fine - otherwise it needs to be dealt with in the article before it can be inserted into the lead. 
 Third point, my earlier comment about this was made with ironic and humorous intent, because I have only come across the term 'romance' used in this context, at conferences, ironically or critically.  Just because a term is used in sources does not mean that it can be used in the lead when it is not in the text, for example, """"Homosexuals deserve to be executed or tortured""""   """,['loathe'],1

"""{{unblock|THANK YOU for a reasonable fucking comment!!! The ONLY USER in ANY AREA who has actually made one!!  (Ebyabe made comments which appear to be reasonable at first glance, but are actually unreasonable because one is fraudulent and the other was untrue regarding a place where she could see that it was untrue.)  Well a sort-of reasonable comment anyway because he claims that I am being """"confrontational"""" when it is clearly visible at my talk page that other users are attacking me and not the other way around.  I have not caused any confrontation...   I have replied to other users who are putting a confrontation to me.  (I did ask how to report a user, but I did not actually report him because nobody answered regardless of several posts made, and the user himself did not comment there, so that was not a confrontation like it would have been if I'd been able to make the report.)  I would like to leave a message at this user User:Stwalkerster's talk page but I cannot, because for some reason those are blocked to, so I have to do it this way instead.  Hopefully he has the notifications turned on (tags of username).  I can be calm and work with other people.  This is noted in my first reply, where it gives several examples of how users should have had discussion instead of attacking and reverting me and arguing hostilely on my talk page.  Users who wish to work with me should not make attacks, write words like """"compliance"""", revert edits when they could have further fixed the edit instead (details of referred-to edits in a separate paragraph below, make false claims against me, or delete my replies on discussion pages (not talk pages) and then ARCHIVE it after removing them!!  (Users should not do these kinds of things to anyone.)  What this means is that if users act in a reasonable manner, then a normal discussion can ensue (including from myself).  Merely because someone has used a template, written a shorter reply, or wrote their aggressive, confrontational remarks in a business-style manner, does not mean that they are """"being reasonable"""" or """"writing nicely"""".  When someone makes a falsified report about you or writes a falsified comment, etc., it is not reasonable to expect the victim to reply without mentioning this, or to want to """"be friends"""" with the attacker.  If the other people are being reasonable then of COURSE I am going to reply to them in a different way.  Editing an article by...(below) is not reasonable, nor is """"ganging up"""" (the discussion page), nor is replying in several places at once, etc.  How can replying to other users stating bad and/or false things about you be """"confrontational""""?  I have mentioned several times about having an actual discussion but no one did this and instead just kept replying on my talk pages.  The fact that I mentioned having a discussion indicates that I think reasonable discussion is the right or reasonable way to do it.  Just no one wanted to do anything but attack me so I did not have another way.

The headlines are not """"veiled"""", they are in plain light.  It was not any attempt to be """"hidden"""".  For headline #5, I literally do or did not know of a different way to title this headline which is not an attack on myself.  For headline #8, it is truthful and the falsification was blatant by Ebyabe, and I actually expected her to edit it to something on her next message.  I mean she directly mentions it; edit summary says a reason but her message says differently (directly, not implied).  For this headline, it is not a """"personal attack"""" because it is true and evident: Administrator complains about my signature even though signature has been changed, and messages by me since posted, before the block happened, as well as direct linking to comments which contain no personal attacks as a reason for """"personal attacks"""".  If the titles were UNTRUE they would be attacks, but since they are true unambiguously then they can't be attacks. The last headline yes, somewhat motivated/hostile, because he is the one put an useless headline so that there's TWO AT ONCE, *AFTER* my notice is up, while also writing the things that show the actual tyranny (a word used in this case solely because it is already being talked about, and not meant as any attack/instigation/hostile/etc.). Although the link by Jamie appears to say something about political opinions, if someone is making false claims then it is appropriate for them to be exposed.

So as you can see my intents are to be reasonable and normal (with the 'possible' exception of this particular headline), and repeatedly asking other people to do this, but being annoyed by all their attacks and false remarks as well.

Bull shit I bet they be sucking alot of dick! My Page wasn't vandalism it was truthism. Look for you self:

Espionage or a dick spying on some pussy lovers involves an individual obtaining information that is considered secret or confidential without the permission of the holder of the information. Espionage is inherently clandestine, as the legitimate holder of the information may change plans or take other countermeasures once it is known that the information is in unauthorized hands. See clandestine HUMINT for the basic concepts of such information collection, and subordinate articles such as clandestine HUMINT operational techniques and clandestine HUMINT asset recruiting for discussions of the """"tradecraft"""" used to collect this information.
Hey I gotta joke and it goes like this:Dick says """"Hey Balls get ready for a patry"""" Balls replies """"You fucking liar. Everytime we go to a party, you always go in and leave us out here knockin.  

History
Incidents of espionage are well documented throughout history. The ancient writings of Chinese and Indian military strategists such as Sun-Tzu and Chanakya contain information on deception and subversion. Chanakya's student Chandragupta Maurya, founder of the Maurya Empire, made use of assassinations, spies and secret agents, which are described in Chanakya's Arthasastra. The ancient Egyptians had a thoroughly developed system for the acquisition of intelligence, and the Hebrews used spies as well, as in the story of Rahab. Feudal Japan often used ninja to gather intelligence. More recently, spies played a significant part in Elizabethan England (see Francis Walsingham). Many modern espionage methods were well established even then. http://www.henrywotton.org.uk/

The Cold War involved intense espionage activity between the United States of America and its allies and the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China and their allies, particularly related to nuclear weapons secrets. Recently, espionage agencies have targeted the illegal drug trade and those considered to be terrorists.

Different intelligence services value certain  intelligence collection techniques over others. The former Soviet Union, for example, preferred  human sources over  research in open sources, while the United States has tended to emphasize technological methods such as SIGINT and IMINT. Both Soviet political (KGB) and military intelligence (GRU
 ) officers were judged by the number of agents they recruited. 

Various Forms
Unlike other forms of  intelligence collection disciplines, espionage usually involves accessing the place where the desired information is stored, or accessing the people who know the information and will divulge it through some kind of subterfuge. There are exceptions to physical meetings, such as the Oslo Report, or the insistence of Robert Hanssen in never meeting the people to whom he was selling information.

The US defines espionage towards itself as """"The act of obtaining, delivering, transmitting, communicating, or receiving information about the national defense with an intent, or reason to believe, that the information may be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation. Espionage is a violation of 18 United States Code 792-798 and Article 106, Uniform Code of Military Justice{{cite web
